Abstract: This specification defines an API that enables web pages to access WebAuthn compliant strong cryptographic credentials
    through browser script. Conceptually, one or more credentials are stored on an authenticator, and each credential is scoped
    to a single Relying Party. Authenticators are responsible for ensuring that no operation is performed without the user's
    consent. The user agent mediates access to credentials in order to preserve user privacy. Authenticators use attestation
    to provide cryptographic proof of their properties to the relying party. This specification also describes a functional
    model of a WebAuthn compliant authenticator, including its signature and attestation functionality.

# Use Cases # {#use-cases}

[INFORMATIVE]

This specification defines an API for web pages to access scoped credentials through JavaScript, for the purpose of strongly
authenticating a user. Scoped credentials are always scoped to a single <a>[RP]</a>. This scoping is enforced jointly by the
User Agent implementing the Web Authentication API and the authenticator that holds the credential, by constraining the
availability and usage of credentials. Scoped credentials created by a [RP] can only be accessed by web origins belonging to that
[RP]. Additionally, privacy across [RPS] must be maintained; scripts must not be able to detect any properties, or even the
existence, of scoped credentials belonging to other [RPS].

Scoped credentials are located on <a>authenticators</a>, which can use them to perform operations subject to user consent.
Broadly, authenticators are of two types:

1. <dfn>Embedded authenticators</dfn> have their operation managed by the same computing device (e.g., smart phone, tablet,
    desktop PC) as the user agent is running on. For instance, such an authenticator might consist of a Trusted Platform Module
    (TPM) or Secure Element (SE) integrated into the computing device, along with appropriate platform software to mediate
    access to this device's functionality.

2. <dfn>External authenticators</dfn> operate autonomously from the device running the user agent, and accessed over a transport
    such as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Near Field Communications (NFC).

Note that an external authenticator may itself contain an embedded authenticator. For example, consider a smart phone that
contains a scoped credential. The credential may be accessed by a web browser running on the phone itself. In this case the
module containing the credential is functioning as an embedded authenticator. However, the credential may also be accessed over
BLE by a user agent on a nearby laptop. In this latter case, the phone is functioning as an external authenticator. These modes
may even be used in a single end-to-end user scenario. One such scenario is described in the remainder of this section.


## Registration (<a>embedded authenticator</a> mode) ## {#registration-embedded}

- On the phone:
    * User goes to example.com in the browser, and signs in using whatever method they have been using (possibly a legacy
        method such as a password).
    * The phone prompts, "Do you want to register this device with example.com?"
    * User agrees.
    * The phone prompts the user for a previously configured authorization gesture (PIN, biometric, etc.); the user provides
        this.
    * Website shows message, "Registration complete."


## Authentication (<a>external authenticator</a> mode) ## {#authentication-external}

- On the laptop:
    * User goes to example.com in browser, sees an option "Sign in with your phone."
    * User chooses this option and gets a message from the browser, "Please complete this action on your phone."

- Next, on the phone:
    * User sees a discreet prompt or notification, "Sign in to example.com."
    * User selects this prompt / notification.
    * User is shown a list of their example.com identities, e.g., "Sign in as Alice / Sign in as Bob."
    * User picks an identity, is prompted for an authorization gesture (PIN, biometric, etc.) and provides this.

- Now, on the laptop:
    * Web page shows that the selected user is signed in, and navigates to the signed-in page.


## Other configurations ## {#other-configurations}

A variety of additional use cases and configurations are also possible, including (but not limited to):

- User goes to example.com on their laptop, is guided through a flow to create and register a credential on their phone.

- User employs a scoped credential as described above to authorize a single transaction, such as a payment or other financial
    transaction.


# Conformance # {#conformance}

This specification defines criteria for a <a>Conforming User Agent</a>. A User Agent MUST behave as described in this
specification in order to be considered conformant. User Agents MAY implement algorithms given in this specification in any way
desired, so long as the end result is indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the specification's
algorithms. A conforming Web Authentication API User Agent MUST also be a conforming implementation of the IDL fragments of this
specification, as described in the “Web IDL” specification. [[!WebIDL-1]]

This specification also defines a model of a Web Authentication compliant authenticator. This is a set of functional and
security requirements for an authenticator to be usable by a User Agent that implements the Web Authentication API. As described
in [[#use-cases]], the authenticator itself may be implemented in the operating system underlying the User Agent, or in external
hardware, or a combination of both.


## Dependencies ## {#dependencies}

This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.

: HTML5
:: The concept of <dfn>origin</dfn> and the <dfn>Window</dfn> interface are defined in [[!HTML5]].

: Web IDL
:: Many of the interface definitions and all of the IDL in this specification depend on [[!WebIDL-1]]. This updated version of
    the Web IDL standard adds support for <dfn>Promises</dfn>, which are now the preferred mechanism for asynchronous
    interaction in all new web APIs.

: DOM
:: <dfn>DOMException</dfn> and the DOMException values used in this specification are defined in [[!DOM4]].

: Web Cryptography API
:: The <dfn dictionary>AlgorithmIdentifier</dfn> type and the method for normalizing an algorithm are defined in
    [[WebCryptoAPI#algorithm-dictionary]].
:: The <dfn interface>JsonWebKey</dfn> interface for representing cryptographic keys is defined in
    [[WebCryptoAPI#JsonWebKey-dictionary]].

: Base64url encoding
:: The term <dfn>Base64url Encoding</dfn> refers to the base64 encoding using the URL- and filename-safe character set defined
    in Section 5 of [[!RFC4648]], with all trailing '=' characters omitted (as permitted by Section 3.2) and without the
    inclusion of any line breaks, whitespace, or other additional characters. This is the same encoding as used by JSON Web
    Signature (JWS) [[RFC7515]].


# Web Authentication API # {#api}

This section normatively specifies the API for creating and using scoped credentials. Support for deleting credentials is
deliberately omitted; this is expected to be done through platform-specific user interfaces rather than from a script. The basic
idea is that the credentials belong to the user and are managed by the browser and underlying platform. Scripts can (with the
user's consent) request the browser to create a new credential for future use by the script's origin. Scripts can also request
the user’s permission to perform authentication operations with an existing credential held by the platform. However, all such
operations are mediated by the browser and/or platform on the user's behalf. At no point does the script get access to the
credentials themselves; it only gets information about the credentials in the form of objects.

User agents SHOULD only expose this API to callers in <dfn>secure contexts</dfn>, as defined in [[powerful-features]].

The API is defined by the following Web IDL fragment.

<pre class="idl">

</pre>


## <dfn interface>WebAuthentication</dfn> Interface ## {#iface-credential}

This interface has two methods, which are described in the following subsections.


### Create a new credential (<dfn method for="WebAuthentication">makeCredential()</dfn> method) ### {#makeCredential}

With this method, a script can request the User Agent to create a new credential of a given type and persist it to the
underlying platform, which may involve data storage managed by the browser or the OS. The user agent will prompt the user to
approve this operation. On success, the promise will be resolved with a {{ScopedCredentialInfo}} object describing the newly
created credential.

This method takes the following parameters:

- The <dfn>accountInformation</dfn> parameter specifies information about the user account for which the credential is being
    created. This is meant for later use by the authenticator when it needs to prompt the user to select a credential.

- The <dfn>cryptoParameters</dfn> parameter supplies information about the desired properties of the credential to be created.
    The sequence is ordered from most preferred to least preferred. The platform makes a best effort to create the most
    preferred credential that it can.

- The <dfn>attestationChallenge</dfn> parameter contains a challenge intended to be used for generating the attestation
    statement of the newly created credential.

- The optional <dfn>credentialTimeoutSeconds</dfn> parameter specifies a time, in seconds, that the caller is willing to wait
    for the call to complete. This is treated as a hint, and may be overridden by the platform.

- The optional <dfn>blacklist</dfn> parameter is intended for use by <a>[RPS]</a> that wish to limit the creation of multiple
    credentials for the same account on a single authenticator. The platform is requested to return an error if the new
    credential would be created on an authenticator that also contains one of the credentials enumerated in this parameter.

- The optional <dfn>credentialExtensions</dfn> parameter contains additional parameters requesting additional processing by
    the client and authenticator. For example, the caller may request that only authenticators with certain capabilities be
    used to create the credential, or that additional information be returned in the attestation statement. Alternatively, the
    caller may specify an additional message that they would like the authenticator to display to the user. Extensions are
    defined in [[#extensions]].

When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST execute the following algorithm:

1. If <a>credentialTimeoutSeconds</a> was specified, check if its value lies within a reasonable range as defined by the
    platform and if not, correct it to the closest value lying within that range. Set |adjustedTimeout| to this adjusted value.
    If <a>credentialTimeoutSeconds</a> was not specified then set |adjustedTimeout| to a platform-specific default.

2. Let |promise| be a new <a data-lt="Promises">Promise</a>. Return |promise| and start a timer for |adjustedTimeout| seconds.
    Then asynchronously continue executing the following steps.

3. Set |callerOrigin| to the <a>origin</a> of the caller. Derive the RP ID from |callerOrigin| by computing the
    "public suffix + 1" or "PS+1" (which is also referred to as the "Effective Top-Level Domain plus One" or "<a>eTLD+1</a>")
    part of |callerOrigin| [[PSL]]. Set |rpId| to the RP ID.

4. Initialize |issuedRequests| to an empty list.

5. Process each element of <a>cryptoParameters</a> using the following steps:
    - Let |current| be the currently selected element of <a>cryptoParameters</a>.
    - If `current.type` does not contain a {{CredentialType}} supported by this implementation, then stop processing |current|
        and move on to the next element in <a>cryptoParameters</a>.
    - Let |normalizedAlgorithm| be the result of normalizing an algorithm using the procedure defined in [[!WebCryptoAPI]],
        with |alg| set to `current.algorithm` and |op| set to 'generateKey'. If an error occurs during this procedure, then
        stop processing |current| and move on to the next element in <a>cryptoParameters</a>.

6. If <a>blacklist</a> is undefined, set it to the empty list.

7. If <a>credentialExtensions</a> was specified, process any extensions supported by this client platform, to produce the
    extension data that needs to be sent to the authenticator. Call this data |clientExtensions|.

8. For each embedded or external authenticator currently available on this platform: asynchronously invoke the
    <a>authenticatorMakeCredential</a> operation on that authenticator with |callerOrigin|, |rpId|, <a>accountInformation</a>,
    `current.type`, |normalizedAlgorithm|, <a>blacklist</a>, <a>attestationChallenge</a> and |clientExtensions| as parameters.
    Add a corresponding entry to |issuedRequests|.

9. While |issuedRequests| is not empty, perform the following actions depending upon the |adjustedTimeout| timer and responses
    from the authenticators:
    - If the |adjustedTimeout| timer expires, then for each entry in |issuedRequests| invoke the <a>authenticatorCancel</a>
        operation on that authenticator and remove its entry from the list.
    - If any authenticator returns a status indicating that the user cancelled the operation, delete that authenticator's
        entry from |issuedRequests|. For each remaining entry in |issuedRequests| invoke the <a>authenticatorCancel</a>
        operation on that authenticator and remove its entry from the list.
    - If any authenticator returns an error status, delete the corresponding entry from |issuedRequests|.
    - If any authenticator indicates success, create a new {{ScopedCredentialInfo}} object named |value| and populate its
        fields with the values returned from the authenticator. Resolve |promise| with |value| and terminate this algorithm.

10. Resolve |promise| with a <a>DOMException</a> whose name is "NotFoundError", and terminate this algorithm.

During the above process, the user agent SHOULD show some UI to the user to guide them in the process of selecting and
authorizing an authenticator.


### Use an existing credential (<dfn method for="WebAuthentication">getAssertion()</dfn> method) ### {#getAssertion}

This method is used to discover and use an existing scoped credential, with the user's consent. The script optionally specifies
some criteria to indicate what credentials are acceptable to it. The user agent and/or platform locates credentials matching the
specified criteria, and guides the user to pick one that the script should be allowed to use. The user may choose not to provide
a credential even if one is present, for example to maintain privacy.

This method takes the following parameters:

- The <dfn>assertionChallenge</dfn> parameter contains a challenge that the selected authenticator is expected to sign to
    produce the assertion.

- The optional <dfn>assertionTimeoutSeconds</dfn> parameter specifies a time, in seconds, that the caller is willing to wait
    for the call to complete. This is treated as a hint, and may be overridden by the platform.

- The optional <dfn>whitelist</dfn> member contains a list of credentials acceptable to the caller, in order of the caller's
    preference.

- The optional <dfn>assertionExtensions</dfn> parameter contains additional parameters requesting additional processing by the
    client and authenticator. For example, if transaction confirmation is sought from the user, then the prompt string would be
    included in an extension. Extensions are defined in a companion specification.

When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST execute the following algorithm:

1. If <a>assertionTimeoutSeconds</a> was specified, check if its value lies within a reasonable range as defined by the platform
    and if not, correct it to the closest value lying within that range. Set |adjustedTimeout| to this adjusted value. If
    <a>assertionTimeoutSeconds</a> was not specified then set |adjustedTimeout| to a platform-specific default.

2. Let |promise| be a new <a data-lt="Promises">Promise</a>. Return |promise| and start a timer for |adjustedTimeout| seconds.
    Then asynchronously continue executing the following steps.

3. Set |callerOrigin| to the <a>origin</a> of the caller. Derive the RP ID from |callerOrigin| by computing the
    "public suffix + 1" or "PS+1" (which is also referred to as the "Effective Top-Level Domain plus One" or "<a>eTLD+1</a>")
    part of |callerOrigin| [[PSL]]. Set |rpId| to the RP ID.

4. Initialize |issuedRequests| to an empty list.

5. If <a>assertionExtensions</a> was specified, process any extensions supported by this client platform, to produce the
    extension data that needs to be sent to the authenticator. Call this data |clientExtensions|.

6. For each embedded or external authenticator currently available on this platform, perform the following steps:
    - If <a>whitelist</a> is undefined or empty, let |credentialList| be a list containing a single wildcard entry.
    <!-- TBD The wildcard syntax needs to be defined and/or referenced here. -->
    - If <a>whitelist</a> is defined and non-empty, optionally execute a platform-specific procedure to determine which of these
        credentials can possibly be present on this authenticator. Set |credentialList| to this filtered list. If
        |credentialList| is empty, ignore this authenticator and do not perform any of the following per-authenticator steps.
    - Asynchronously invoke the <a>authenticatorGetAssertion</a> operation on this authenticator with |callerOrigin|, |rpId|,
        <a>assertionChallenge</a>, |credentialList|, and |clientExtensions| as parameters.
    - Add an entry to |issuedRequests|, corresponding to this request.

7. While |issuedRequests| is not empty, perform the following actions depending upon the |adjustedTimeout| timer and responses
    from the authenticators:
    - If the timer for |adjustedTimeout| expires, then for each entry in |issuedRequests| invoke the <a>authenticatorCancel</a>
        operation on that authenticator and remove its entry from the list.
    - If any authenticator returns a status indicating that the user cancelled the operation, delete that authenticator's entry
        from |issuedRequests|. For each remaining entry in |issuedRequests| invoke the <a>authenticatorCancel</a> operation on
        that authenticator, and remove its entry from the list.
    - If any authenticator returns an error status, delete the corresponding entry from |issuedRequests|.
    - If any authenticator returns success, create a new {{WebAuthnAssertion}} object named |value| and populate its fields
        with the values returned from the authenticator. Resolve |promise| with |value| and terminate this algorithm.

8. Resolve |promise| with a <a>DOMException</a> whose name is "NotFoundError", and terminate this algorithm.

During the above process, the user agent SHOULD show some UI to the user to guide them in the process of selecting and
authorizing an authenticator with which to complete the operation.


## <dfn interface>ScopedCredentialInfo</dfn> Interface ## {#iface-credentialInfo}

<div dfn-for="ScopedCredentialInfo">
    This interface represents a newly-created scoped credential. It contains information about the credential that can be used
    to locate it later for use, and also contains metadata that can be used by the <a>[RP]</a> to assess the strength of the
    credential during registration.

    The <dfn>credential</dfn> attribute contains a unique identifier for the credential represented by this object.

    The <dfn>publicKey</dfn> attribute contains the public key associated with the credential, represented as a JsonWebKey
    structure as defined in [[WebCryptoAPI#JsonWebKey-dictionary]].

    The <dfn>attestation</dfn> attribute contains a key attestation statement returned by the authenticator. This provides
    information about the credential and the authenticator it is held in, such as the level of security assurance provided by
    the authenticator.
</div>


## User Account Information (dictionary <dfn dictionary>Account</dfn>) ## {#iface-account}

<div dfn-for="Account">
    This dictionary is used by the caller to specify information about the user account and <a>[RP]</a> with which a credential
    is to be associated. It is intended to help the authenticator in providing a friendly credential selection interface for the
    user.

    The <dfn>rpDisplayName</dfn> member contains the friendly name of the [RP], such as "Acme Corporation", "Widgets Inc" or
    "Awesome Site".

    The <dfn>displayName</dfn> member contains the friendly name associated with the user account by the [RP], such as "John P.
    Smith".

    The <dfn>name</dfn> member contains a detailed name for the account, such as "john.p.smith@example.com".

    The <dfn>id</dfn> member contains an identifier for the account, stored for the use of the [RP]. This is not meant to be
    displayed to the user.

    The <dfn>imageURL</dfn> member contains a URL that resolves to the user's account image. This may be a URL that can be used
    to retrieve an image containing the user's current avatar, or a data URI that contains the image data.
</div>


## Parameters for Credential Generation (dictionary <dfn dictionary>ScopedCredentialParameters</dfn>) ## {#credential-params}

<div dfn-for="ScopedCredentialParameters">
    This dictionary is used to supply additional parameters when creating a new credential.

    The <dfn>type</dfn> member specifies the type of credential to be created.

    The <dfn>algorithm</dfn> member specifies the cryptographic algorithm with which the newly generated credential will be
    used.
</div>


## WebAuthn Assertion (interface <dfn interface>WebAuthnAssertion</dfn>) ## {#iface-assertion}

Scoped credentials produce a cryptographic signature that provides proof of possession of a private key as well as evidence of
user consent to a specific transaction. The structure of these signatures is defined as follows.

<div dfn-for="WebAuthnAssertion">
    The <dfn>credential</dfn> member represents the credential that was used to generate this assertion.

    The <dfn>clientData</dfn> member contains the parameters sent to the authenticator by the client, in serialized form. See
    [[#sec-client-data]] for the format of this parameter and how it is generated.

    The <b><em>authenticatorData</em></b> member contains the serialized data returned by the authenticator. See
    [[#sec-authenticator-data]].

    The <dfn>signature</dfn> member contains the raw signature returned from the authenticator. See
    [[#authenticator-signature]].
</div>


## WebAuthn Assertion Extensions (dictionary <dfn dictionary>WebAuthnExtensions</dfn>) ## {#iface-assertion-extensions}

This is a dictionary containing zero or more extensions as defined in [[#extensions]]. An extension is an additional parameter
that can be passed to the <a>getAssertion()</a> method and triggers some additional processing by the client platform and/or the
authenticator.

If the caller wants to pass extensions to the platform, it SHOULD do so by adding one entry per extension to this dictionary
with the extension identifier as the key, and the extension's value as the value (see [[#signature-format]] for details).


## Credential Attestation Statement (interface <dfn interface>WebAuthnAttestation</dfn>) ## {#iface-attestation}

Authenticators also provide some form of attestation. The basic requirement is that the authenticator can produce, for each
credential public key, attestation information that can be verified by a <a>[RP]</a>. Typically, this information contains a
signature by an attesting key over the attested public key and a challenge, as well as a certificate or similar information
providing provenance information for the attesting key, enabling a trust decision to be made.

<div dfn-for="WebAuthnAttestation">
    The <dfn>type</dfn> member specifies the type of attestation statement contained in this structure. This specification
    defines a number of attestation types, in [[#defined-attestation-types]]. Other attestation types may be defined in later
    versions of this specification.

    The <dfn>clientData</dfn> member contains the <a>clientDataJSON</a> (see [[#signature-format]]). The exact JSON encoding
    must be preserved as the hash (clientDataHash) has been computed over it.

    The <dfn>statement</dfn> element contains the actual attestation statement. The structure of this object depends on the
    attestation type. For more details, see [[#attestation]].
</div>

This attestation statement is delivered to the <a>[RP]</a> by the [RP]'s script running on the client, using methods outside
the scope of this specification. It contains all the information that the [RP]'s server requires to validate the statement, as
well as to decode and validate the bindings of both the client and authenticator data.


## Supporting Data Structures ## {#supporting-data-structures}

The scoped credential type uses certain data structures that are specified in supporting specifications. These are as follows.


### Credential Type enumeration (enum <dfn enum>CredentialType</dfn>) ### {#credentialType}

<div dfn-for="CredentialType">
    This enumeration defines the valid credential types. It is an extension point; values may be added to it in the future, as
    more credential types are defined. The values of this enumeration are used for versioning the WebAuthn assertion and
    attestation statement according to the type of the authenticator.

    Currently one credential type is defined, namely "<dfn>ScopedCred</dfn>".
</div>


### Unique Identifier for Credential (interface <dfn interface>Credential</dfn>) ### {#credential-identifier}

This interface contains the attributes that are returned to the caller when a new credential is created, and can be used later
by the caller to select a credential for use.

<div dfn-for="Credential">
    The <dfn>type</dfn> attribute indicates the specification and version that this credential conforms to.

    The <dfn>id</dfn> attribute contains an identifier for the credential, chosen by the platform with help from the
    authenticator. This identifier is used to look up credentials for use, and is therefore expected to be globally unique with
    high probability across all credentials of the same type, across all authenticators. This API does not constrain the format
    or length of this identifier, except that it must be sufficient for the platform to uniquely select a key. For example, an
    authenticator without on-board storage may create identifiers that consist of the key material wrapped with a key that is
    burned into the authenticator.
</div>


### Cryptographic Algorithm Identifier (type {{AlgorithmIdentifier}}) ### {#alg-identifier}

A string or dictionary identifying a cryptographic algorithm and optionally a set of parameters for that algorithm. This type is
defined in [[!WebCryptoAPI]].


# WebAuthn Authenticator model # {#authenticator-model}

The API defined in this specification implies a specific abstract functional model for an <a>authenticator</a>. This section
describes the authenticator model. Client platforms may implement and expose this abstract model in any way desired. However,
the behavior of the client's Web Authentication API implementation, when operating on the embedded and external authenticators
supported by that platform, MUST be indistinguishable from the behavior specified in [[#api]].

In this abstract model, each authenticator stores some number of scoped credentials. Each scoped credential has an identifier
which is unique (or extremely unlikely to be duplicated) among all scoped credentials. Each credential is also associated with a
<a>[RP]</a>, whose identity is represented by a <dfn>Relying Party Identifier</dfn> (RP ID).


## Authenticator operations ## {#authenticator-ops}

A client must connect to an authenticator in order to invoke any of the operations of that authenticator. This connection
defines an authenticator session. An authenticator must maintain isolation between sessions. It may do this by only allowing one
session to exist at any particular time, or by providing more complicated session management.

The following operations can be invoked by the client in an authenticator session.


### The <dfn>authenticatorMakeCredential</dfn> operation ### {#op-make-cred}

This operation must be invoked in an authenticator session which has no other operations in progress. It takes the following
input parameters:

- The web origin of the script on whose behalf the operation is being initiated, as determined by the user agent and the client.

- The RP ID corresponding to the above web origin, as determined by the user agent and the client.

- All input parameters accepted by the {{makeCredential()}} method.

When this operation is invoked, the authenticator obtains user consent for creating a new credential. The prompt for obtaining 
this consent is shown by the authenticator if it has its own output capability, or by the user agent otherwise. Once user 
consent is obtained, the authenticator generates the appropriate cryptographic keys and creates a new credential. It also 
generates an identifier for the credential, such that this identifier is globally unique with high probability across all 
credentials with the same type across all authenticators. It then associates the credential with the specified RP ID such that
it will be able to retrieve the RP ID later, given the credential ID. 

On successful completion of this operation, the authenticator returns the type and unique identifier of this new credential to
the user agent.

If the user refuses consent, the authenticator returns an appropriate error status to the client.


### The <dfn>authenticatorGetAssertion</dfn> operation ### {#op-get-assertion}

This operation must be invoked in an authenticator session which has no other operations in progress. It takes the following
input parameters:

- The web origin of the script on whose behalf the operation is being initiated, as determined by the user agent and the client.

- The RP ID corresponding to the above web origin, as determined by the user agent and the client.

- All input parameters accepted by the {{getAssertion()}} method, specified below.

When this method is invoked, the authenticator allows the user to select a credential from among the credentials associated with
that [RP] and matching the specified criteria, then obtains user consent for using that credential. The prompt for obtaining
this consent may be shown by the authenticator if it has its own output capability, or by the user agent otherwise. Once a
credential is selected and user consent is obtained, the authenticator computes a cryptographic signature using the credential's
private key and constructs an assertion as specified in [[#signature-format]]. It then returns this assertion to the user agent.

If the authenticator cannot find any credential corresponding to the specified [RP] that matches the specified criteria, it
terminates the operation and returns an error.

If the user refuses consent, the authenticator returns an appropriate error status to the client.


### The <dfn>authenticatorCancel</dfn> operation ### {#op-cancel}

This operation takes no input parameters and returns no result.

When this operation is invoked by the client in an authenticator session, it has the effect of terminating any
<a>authenticatorMakeCredential</a> or <a>authenticatorGetAssertion</a> operation currently in progress in that authenticator
session. The authenticator stops prompting for, or accepting, any user input related to authorizing the canceled operation. The
client ignores any further responses from the authenticator for the canceled operation.

This operation is ignored if it is invoked in an authenticator session which does not have an <a>authenticatorMakeCredential</a>
or <a>authenticatorGetAssertion</a> operation currently in progress.


## Signature Format ## {#signature-format}

WebAuthn signatures are bound to various contextual data. These data are observed, and added at different levels of the stack as
a signature request passes from the server to the authenticator. In verifying a signature, the server checks these bindings
against expected values.

The components of a system using WebAuthn can be divided into three layers:

1. The <a>[RP]</a> (RP), which uses the WebAuthn services. The RP may, for example, be a web-application running in a browser,
    or a native application that runs directly on the OS platform.

2. The <a>WebAuthn Client</a> platform, which consists of the user’s OS and device used to host the RP’s client-side app. For
    web-applications, the browser also belongs to this layer.

3. The <a>Authenticator</a> itself, which provides key management and cryptographic signatures.

When the [RP] client-side application is a web-application, the interface between 1 and 2 is the [[#api]], but is platform
specific for native applications. In cases where the authenticator is not tightly integrated with the platform, the interface
between 2 and 3 is a separately-defined protocol. This specification defines the common signature format shared by all layers.
This includes how the different contextual bindings are encoded, signed over, and delivered to the RP.

The goals of this design can be summarized as follows.

- The scheme for generating signatures should accommodate cases where the link between the client platform and authenticator
    is very limited, in bandwidth and/or latency. Examples include Bluetooth Low Energy and Near-Field Communication.

- The data processed by the authenticator should be small and easy to interpret in low-level code. In particular, authenticators
    should not have to parse high-level encodings such as JSON.

- Both the client platform and the authenticator should have the flexibility to add contextual bindings as needed.

- The design aims to reuse as much as possible of existing encoding formats in order to aid adoption and implementation.

The contextual bindings are divided in two: Those added by the RP or the client platform, referred to as client data; and those
added by the authenticator, referred to as the authenticator data. The client data must be signed over, but an authenticator is
otherwise not interested in its contents. To save bandwidth and processing requirements on the authenticator, the client
platform hashes the client data and sends only the result to the authenticator. The authenticator signs over the combination of
this hash, and its own authenticator data.


### Client data used in WebAuthn signatures (dictionary <dfn dictionary>ClientData</dfn>) ### {#sec-client-data}

The client data represents the contextual bindings of both the [RP] and the client platform. It is a key-value mapping with
string-valued keys. Values may be any type that has a valid encoding in JSON. Its structure is defined by the following Web IDL.

<pre class="idl">
    dictionary ClientData {
        required DOMString           challenge;
        required DOMString           facet;
        required AlgorithmIdentifier hashAlg;
        JsonWebKey                   tokenBinding;
        WebAuthnExtensions           extensions;
    };
</pre>

<div dfn-for="ClientData">
    The <dfn>challenge</dfn> member contains the base64url encoding of the challenge provided by the RP.

    The <dfn>facet</dfn> member contains a string value describing the RP identifier facet. When the [RP] client-side app is a
    website, this is its fully qualified web origin, using the syntax defined by [[RFC6454]]. When the client-side app is a
    native application, this string is a platform specific identifier.

    The <dfn>hashAlg</dfn> member specifies the hash algorithm used to compute clientDataHash (see
    [[#authenticator-signature]]). Use "S256" for SHA-256, "S384" for SHA384, "S512" for SHA512, and "SM3" for SM3 (see
    [[#iana-considerations]]).

    The <dfn>tokenBinding</dfn> member contains a JsonWebKey object as defined by [[WebCryptoAPI#JsonWebKey-dictionary]]
    describing the public key that this client uses for the Token Binding protocol when communicating with the [RP]. This can be
    omitted if no Token Binding has been negotiated between the client and the [RP].

    The optional <dfn>extensions</dfn> member contains additional parameters generated by processing the extensions passed in
    by the [RP]. WebAuthn extensions are detailed in Section [[#extensions]].
</div>


### Authenticator data ### {#sec-authenticator-data}

The authenticator data encodes contextual bindings made by the <a>authenticator</a> itself. The authenticator data has a compact
but extensible encoding. This is desired since authenticators can be devices with limited capabilities and low power
requirements, with much simpler software stacks than the client platform components.

The encoding of authenticator data is a byte array [[WebCryptoAPI#JsonWebKey-dictionary]] of 5 bytes or more, as follows.

<table class="complex data longlastcol">
    <tr>
        <th>Byte index</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>
            Flags (bit 0 is the least significant bit):
            - Bit 0: Test of User Presence (`TUP`) result.
            - Bits 1-6: Reserved for future use (`RFU`).
            - Bit 7: Extension data included (`ED`). Indicates if the authenticator data has extensions.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1-4</td>
        <td>Signature counter (`signCount`), 32-bit unsigned big-endian integer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5-</td>
        <td>
            Extension-defined authenticator data. This is a CBOR [[RFC7049]] map with extension identifiers as keys, and
            extension authenticator data values as values. See [[#extensions]] for details.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The `TUP` flag SHALL be set if and only if the authenticator detected a user through an authenticator specific gesture. The
`RFU` bits in the flags byte SHALL be set to zero.

If the authenticator does not include any extension data, it MUST set the `ED` flag in the first byte to zero, and to one if
extension data is included.

The figure below shows a visual representation of the authenticator data structure.

<figure>
    <img src="img/fido-signature-formats-figure1.svg"/>
    <figcaption><dfn>authenticatorData</dfn> layout.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: The `signatureData` describes its own length: If the ED flag is not set, it is always 5 bytes long. If the ED flag is set,
it is 5 bytes plus the CBOR map that follows.


### Generating a signature ### {#authenticator-signature}

Before making a request to an authenticator, the client platform layer SHALL perform the following steps.

1. Represent the parameters passed in by the RP in the form of a {{ClientData}} structure.
 
2. Let <dfn>clientDataJSON</dfn> be the UTF-8 encoded JSON serialization [[RFC7159]] of this ClientData dictionary.

3. Let <dfn>clientDataHash</dfn> be the hash (computed using <a>hashAlg</a>) of <a>clientDataJSON</a>, as an array.

The |clientDataHash| value is delivered to the authenticator.

The hash algorithm <a>hashAlg</a> used to compute <a>clientDataHash</a> is included in the {{ClientData}} object. This way it
is available to the [RP] and it is also hashed over when computing <a>clientDataHash</a> and hence anchored in the signature
itself.

A raw cryptographic signature must assert the integrity of both the client data and the authenticator data. Thus, an
<a>authenticator</a> SHALL compute a signature over the concatenation of the |authenticatorData| and the |clientDataHash|.

<figure id="fig-signature">
    <img src="img/fido-signature-formats-figure2.svg"/>
    <figcaption>Generating a signature on the authenticator.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note: A simple, undelimited concatenation is safe to use here because the |authenticatorData| describes its own length. The
    |clientDataHash| (which potentially has a variable length) is always the last element.

The authenticator MUST return both the <a>authenticatorData</a> and the raw signature back to the client. The client, in turn,
MUST return <a>clientDataJSON</a>, <a>authenticatorData</a> and the signature to the RP. The <a>clientDataJSON</a> is returned
in the `clientData` member of the {{WebAuthnAssertion}} and {{AttestationStatement}} structures.


## Credential Attestation Statements ## {#attestation}

An attestation statement is a specific type of signature, which contains statements about a credential itself and the
authenticator that holds it. Therefore, the procedures for generating attestation statements closely parallel those for
generating WebAuthn assertions as described in [[#signature-format]], though the semantics of the contextual bindings are quite
different.

This specification defines a number of attestation types, i.e., ways to serialize the data being attested to by the
<a>Authenticator</a>. The reason is to be able to support existing devices like TPMs and other platform-specific formats. Each
attestation type provides the ability to cryptographically attest to a public key, the authenticator model, and contextual data
to a remote party. They differ in the details of how the attestation statement is laid out, and how its components are computed.
The different attestation types are defined in [[#defined-attestation-types]].

Attestation types are orthogonal to attestation models, i.e. attestation types in general are not restricted
to a single attestation model.


### Attestation Models ### {#attestation-models}

WebAuthn supports multiple attestation models:

: Full Basic Attestation
:: In the case of full basic attestation [[UAFProtocol]], the Authenticator's attestation private key is specific to an
    Authenticator model.  That means that an Authenticator of the same model typically shares the same attestation private key.
    This model is also used for FIDO UAF 1.0 and FIDO U2F 1.0.

: Surrogate Basic Attestation
:: In the case of surrogate basic attestation [[UAFProtocol]], the Authenticator doesn't have any specific attestation key.
    Instead it uses the authentication key to (self-)sign the (surrogate) attestation message. Authenticators without meaningful
    protection measures for an attestation private key typically use this attestation model.

: Privacy CA
:: In this case, the Authenticator owns an authenticator-specific (endorsement) key. This key is used to securely communicate
    with a trusted third party, the Privacy CA.  The Authenticator can generate multiple attestation key pairs and asks the
    Privacy CA to issue an attestation certificate for it. Using this approach, the Authenticator can limit the exposure of the
    endorsement key (which is a global correlation handle) to Privacy CA(s). Attestation keys can be requested for each scoped
    credential individually.

    Note: This concept typically leads to multiple attestation certificates. The attestation certificate requested most recently
        is called "active".

: Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA)
:: In this case, the Authenticator receives DAA credentials from a single DAA-Issuer. These DAA credentials are used along with
    blinding to sign the attestation data. The concept of blinding avoids the DAA credentials being misused as global
    correlation handle. WebAuthn supports DAA using elliptic curve cryptography and bilinear pairings, called ECDAA (see
    [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]) in this specification.


Compliant servers MUST support all attestation models. Authenticators can choose what attestation model to implement.

Note: [RPS] can always decide what attestation models are acceptable to them by policy.


### Defined Attestation Types ### {#defined-attestation-types}

WebAuthn supports pluggable attestation data types. This allows support of TPM generated attestation data as well as support of
other WebAuthn <a>authenticators</a>. As mentioned in [[#attestation]], these differ in how the attestation statement is
computed and formatted. This section defines these details.

The contents of the attestation data must be controlled (i.e., generated or at least verified) by the authenticator itself.


#### Packed Attestation (type="packed") #### {#packed-attestation}

Packed attestation is a WebAuthn optimized format of attestation data. It uses a very compact but still extensible encoding
method. Encoding this format can even be implemented by <a>authenticators</a> with very limited resources (e.g., secure
elements).

A Packed Attestation statement has the following format:

<pre class="idl">
    interface AttestationStatement {
        readonly    attribute unsigned long version;
        readonly    attribute ArrayBuffer   claimedAAGUID;
        readonly    attribute DOMString[]   x5c;
        readonly    attribute DOMString     alg;
        readonly    attribute ArrayBuffer   rawData;
        readonly    attribute ArrayBuffer   signature;
    };
</pre>

<div dfn-for="AttestationStatement">
    The <dfn>version</dfn> member specifies the version number of the rawData object. Only version="1" is defined at this time.

    The <dfn>claimedAAGUID</dfn> element contains the claimed Authenticator Attestation GUID (a version 4 GUID, see
    [[RFC4122]]). This value is used by the <a>[RP]</a> to look up the trust anchor for verifying the following signature. If
    the verification succeeds, the AAGUID related to the trust anchor is trusted. This field MUST be present, if either no
    attestation certificates are used (e.g., DAA) or if the attestation certificate doesn't contain the AAGUID value in an
    extension.

    The <dfn>x5c</dfn> attribute contains the attestation certificate and its certificate chain as described in [[!RFC7515]]
    section 4.1.6.

    The <dfn>alg</dfn> element contains the name of the algorithm used to generate the attestation signature according to
    [[!RFC7518]] section 3.1.

    The <dfn>rawData</dfn> object contains the attested public key and the |clientDataHash|. See [[#sec-raw-data-packed]] for
    details.

    The <dfn>signature</dfn> element contains the attestation signature. See [[#packed-attestation-signature]] for details.
</div>


##### Attestation rawData ##### {#sec-raw-data-packed}

The attestation data encodes contextual bindings made by the <a>authenticator</a> itself. Unlike client data, the authenticator
data has a compact but extensible encoding. This is desired since authenticators can be devices with limited capabilities and
low power requirements, with much simpler software stacks than the client platform components.

The field `rawData` for this type is a byte array of 45 bytes + length of public key + length of KeyHandle + potentially more 
extensions. The first bytes before the extensions have a fixed layout as follows: 

<table class="complex data longlastcol">
    <tr>
        <th>Length (in bytes)</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>
            0xF1D0, fixed big-endian TAG to make sure this object won't be confused with other (non-WebAuthn) binary objects.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>
            Flags (bit 0 is the least significant bit):
            - Bit 0: Test of User Presence (`TUP`) result.
            - Bits 1-6: Reserved for future use (`RFU`).
            - Bit 7: Extension data included (`ED`). Indicates whether the authenticator added extensions (see below).
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Signature counter (`signCount`), 32-bit unsigned big-endian integer.</td>

        <td>
            Public key algorithm and encoding (16-bit big-endian value). Allowed values are:

            1. 0x0100. This is raw ANSI X9.62 formatted Elliptic Curve public key [[!SEC1]], i.e.,
                `[0x04, X (n bytes), Y (n bytes)]`, where the byte `0x04` denotes the uncompressed point compression method and
                n denotes the key length in bytes.

            2. 0x0102.  Raw encoded RSA PKCS1 or RSASSA-PSS public key [[RFC3447]]. In the case of RSASSA-PSS, the default
                parameters according to [[RFC4055]] MUST be assumed, i.e.,
                - Mask Generation Algorithm MGF1 with SHA256
                - Salt Length of 32 bytes, i.e., the length of a SHA256 hash value.
                - Trailer Field value of 1, which represents the trailer field with hexadecimal value `0xBC`.

                That is, `[modulus (256 bytes), e (m-n bytes)]`, where `m` is the total length of the field. This total length
                should be taken from the object containing this key

</table>

The `TUP` flag SHALL be set if and only if the <a>authenticator</a> detected a user through an authenticator-specific gesture.
The `RFU` bits in the flags byte SHALL be cleared (i.e., zeroed).

If the authenticator does not wish to add extensions, it MUST clear the `ED` flag in the third byte.


##### Signature ##### {#packed-attestation-signature}

The `signature` is computed over the `rawData` field. The following algorithms must be implemented by servers:

1. "ES256" [[!RFC7518]]
2. "RS256" [[!RFC7518]]
3. "PS256" [[!RFC7518]]
4. "ED256" [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]

<a>Authenticators</a> can choose which algorithm(s) to implement. [RPS] must implement all the algorithms implemented by the
authenticators that they support.


##### Packed attestation statement certificate requirements ##### {#packed-attestation-cert-requirements}

Note: In the case of DAA attestation [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]] no <a>attestation certificate</a> is used.

The attestation certificate MUST have the following fields/extensions:

- Version must be set to 3.
- Subject field MUST be set to:
    : Subject-C
    :: Country where the Authenticator vendor is incorporated
    : Subject-O
    :: Legal name of the Authenticator vendor
    : Subject-OU
    :: Authenticator Attestation
    : Subject-CN
    :: No stipulation.

- If the related attestation root certificate is used for multiple authenticator models, the Extension OID
    `1 3 6 1 4 1 45724 1 1 4` (id-fido-gen-ce-aaguid) MUST be present, containing the AAGUID as value.

- The Basic Constraints extension MUST have the CA component set to false

- An Authority Information Access (AIA) extension with entry `id-ad-ocsp` and a CRL Distribution Point extension [[RFC5280]]
    are both optional as the status of attestation certificates is available through the FIDO Metadata Service
    [[FIDOMetadataService]].


#### TPM Attestation (type="tpm") #### {#tpm-attestation}

This attestation type returns an attestation statement in the same format as defined in [[#packed-attestation]]. However the
`rawData` and `signature` fields are computed differently, as described below.


##### Attestation rawData ##### {#sec-raw-data-tpm}

The value of `rawData` is either a TPM_CERTIFY_INFO or a TPM_CERTIFY_INFO2 structure [[TPMv1-2-Part2]] sections 11.1 and 11.2, 
if `version` equals 1. Else, if `version` equals 2, it MUST be a TPMS_ATTEST structure as defined in [[TPMv2-Part2]] section
10.12.9.

The field "extraData" (in the case of TPMS_ATTEST) or the field "data" (in the case of TPM_CERTIFY_INFO or TPM_CERTIFY_INFO2)
MUST contain the `clientDataHash` (see [[#signature-format]).


##### Signature ##### {#tpm-attestation-signature}

If `version` equals 1, (i.e., for TPM 1.2), RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm (section 8.2 of [[RFC3447]]) can be used by
WebAuthn Authenticators (i.e., `alg`="RS256").

If `version` equals 2, the following algorithms can be used by WebAuthn Authenticators:

1. TPM_ALG_RSASSA (0x14).  This is the same algorithm RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 as for version 1 but for use with TPMv2. `alg`="RS256".

2. TPM_ALG_RSAPSS (0x16); `alg`="PS256".

3. TPM_ALG_ECDSA (0x18); `alg`="ES256".

4. TPM_ALG_ECDAA (0x1A); `alg`="ED256".

5. TPM_ALG_SM2 (0x1B); `alg`="SM256".

[RPS] must implement all the algorithms implemented by the authenticators that they support.

The `signature` is computed over the `rawData` field.


##### TPM attestation statement certificate requirements ##### {#tpm-cert-requirements}

TPM <a>attestation certificate</a> MUST have the following fields/extensions:

- Version must be set to 3.

- Subject field MUST be set to empty.

- The Subject Alternative Name extension must be set as defined in [[TPMv2-EK-Profile]] section 3.2.9 if "version" equals 2 and
    [[TPMv1-2-Credential-Profiles]] section 3.2.9 if "version" equals 1.

- The Extended Key Usage extension MUST contain the
    "joint-iso-itu-t(2) internationalorganizations(23) 133 tcg-kp(8) tcg-kp-AIKCertificate(3)" OID.

- The Basic Constraints extension MUST have the CA component set to false

- An Authority Information Access (AIA) extension with entry `id-ad-ocsp` and a CRL Distribution Point extension [[RFC5280]] are
    both optional as the status of attestation certificates is available through the FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]].


#### Android Attestation (type="android") #### {#android-attestation}

When the <a>Authenticator</a> in question is a platform-provided Authenticator on the Android platform, the attestation
statement is based on the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response">SafetyNet
API</a>.

This type of attestation statement is formatted as follows:

<pre class="idl">
    interface AndroidAttestation {
        readonly attribute unsigned long version;
        readonly attribute DOMString     safetyNetResponse;
    };
</pre>

<div dfn-for="AndroidAttestation">
    The <dfn>version</dfn> element is set to the version number of Google Play Services responsible for providing the SafetyNet
    API.

    The <dfn>safetyNetResponse</dfn> element contains the value returned by the above SafetyNet API. This value is a JWS
    [[RFC7515]] object (see <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response">
    SafetyNet online documentation</a>) in Compact Serialization.
</div>


##### Signature ##### {#sec-android-attestation-signature}

For this attestation type, the ClientData dictionary is extended in the following way:

<pre class="idl">
    dictionary AndroidAttestationClientData : ClientData {
        JsonWebKey    publicKey;
        boolean       isInsideSecureHardware;
        DOMString     userAuthentication;
        unsigned long userAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds; // optional
    };
</pre>

<div dfn-for="AndroidAttestationClientData">

In order to generate an attestation statement, the client MUST create clientDataJSON by UTF8-encoding a structure of type
AndroidAttestationClientData, and compute clientDataHash as the hash of clientDataJSON. It must then provide clientDataHash as
the Nonce value when requesting the SafetyNet attestation.


##### Verifying AndroidClientData specific contextual bindings ##### {#verifying-android-contextual-bindings}

A [RP] shall verify the clientData contextual bindings (see step 4 in [[#verifying-an-attestation-statement]]) as follows:

- Check that `AndroidAttestationClientData.challenge` equals the attestationChallenge that was passed into the
    {{makeCredential()}} call.

- Check that the `facet` and `tokenBinding` parameters in the `AndroidAttestationClientData` match the [RP] App.

- Check that `AndroidAttestationClientData.publicKey` is the same key as the one returned in the `ScopedCredentialInfo` by the
    `makeCredential` call.

- Check that the hash of the clientDataJSON matches the `nonce` attribute in the payload of the `safetynetResponse` JWS.

- Check that the `ctsProfileMatch` attribute in the payload of the `safetynetResponse` is true.

- Check that the `apkPackageName` attribute in the payload of the `safetynetResponse` matches package name of the application
    calling SafetyNet API.

- Check that the `apkDigestSha256` attribute in the payload of the `safetynetResponse` matches the package hash of the
    application calling SafetyNet API.

- Check that the `apkCertificateDigestSha256` attribute in the payload of the `safetynetResponse` matches the hash of the
    signing certificate of the application calling SafetyNet API.


### Verifying an Attestation Statement ### {#verifying-an-attestation-statement}

This section outlines the recommended algorithm for verifying an attestation statement, independent of attestation type.

Upon receiving an attestation statement, the [RP] shall:

1. Verify that the attestation statement is properly formatted.

2. If `alg` is not ECDAA (e.g., not "ED256" and not "ED512"):
    - Look up the attestation root certificate from a trusted source. The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]] provides
        an easy way to access such information. The `claimedAAGUID` can be used for this lookup.
    - Verify that the attestation certificate chain is valid and chains up to a trusted root (following [[RFC5280]]).
    - Verify that the attestation certificate has the right Extended Key Usage (EKU) based on the WebAuthn Authenticator type
        (as denoted by the `type` member). In case of a type="tpm", this EKU shall be OID "2.23.133.8.3".
    - If the attestation type is "android", verify that the attestation certificate is issued to the hostname
        "attest.android.com" (see <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response">
        SafetyNet online documentation</a>).
    - Verify that all issuing CA certificates in the chain are valid and not revoked.
    - Verify the `signature` on `rawData` using the attestation certificate public key and algorithm as identified by
        `alg`.
    - Verify `rawData` syntax and that it doesn't contradict the signing algorithm specified in `alg`.
    - If the attestation certificate contains an extension with OID `1 3 6 1 4 1 45724 1 1 4` (id-fido-gen-ce-aaguid) verify
        that the value of this extension matches `claimedAAGUID`.  This identifies the Authenticator model.
    - If such extension doesn't exist, the attestation root certificate is dedicated to a single Authenticator model.

3. If `alg` is ECDAA (e.g., "ED256", "ED512"):
    - Look up the DAA root key from a trusted source.  The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]] provides an easy way to
        access such information. The `claimedAAGUID` can be used for this lookup.
    - Perform DAA-Verify on `signature` for `rawData` (see [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).
    - Verify `rawData` syntax and that it doesn't contradict the signing algorithm specified in `alg`.
    - The DAA root key is dedicated to a single Authenticator model.

4. Verify the contextual bindings (e.g., channel binding) from the clientData (see [[#authenticator-signature]]).

5. Verify that user verification method and other authenticator characteristics related to this authenticator model, match the
    [RP] policy. The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]] provides an easy way to access the authenticator
    characteristics.

The [RP] MAY take any of the below actions when verification of an attestation statement fails:

- Reject the request, such as a registration request, associated with the attestation statement.

- Accept the request associated with the attestation statement but treat the attested Scoped Credential as one with surrogate
    basic attestation (see [[#attestation-models]]), if policy allows it. If doing so, there is no cryptographic proof that the
    Scoped Credential has been generated by a particular Authenticator model. See [[FIDOSecRef]] and [[UAFProtocol]] for more
    details on the relevance on attestation.

Verification of attestation statements requires that the relying party trusts the root of the attestation certificate chain.
Also, the [RP] must have access to certificate status information for the intermediate CA certificates. The relying party must
also be able to build the attestation certificate chain if the client didn't provide this chain in the attestation information.


### Security Considerations ### {#sec-attestation-security-considerations}


#### Privacy #### {#sec-attestation-privacy}

Attestation keys may be used to track users or link various online identities of the same user together. This may be mitigated
in several ways, including:

- A WebAuthn <a>Authenticator</a> manufacturer may choose to ship all of their devices with the same (or a fixed number of)
    attestation key(s) (called Full Basic Attestation). This will anonymize the user at the risk of not being able to revoke a
    particular attestation key should its WebAuthn Authenticator be compromised.

- A WebAuthn Authenticator may be capable of dynamically generating different attestation keys (and requesting related
    certificates) per origin (following the Privacy CA model). For example, a WebAuthn Authenticator can ship with a master
    attestation key (and certificate), and combined with a cloud operated privacy CA, can dynamically generate per origin
    attestation keys and attestation certificates.

- A WebAuthn Authenticator can implement direct anonymous attestation (see [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).  Using this scheme, the
    authenticator generates a blinded attestation signature.  This allows the [RP] to verify the signature using the DAA root
    key, but the attestation signature doesn't serve as a global correlation handle.


#### Attestation Certificate and Attestation Certificate CA Compromise #### {#ca-compromise}

When an intermediate CA or a root CA used for issuing attestation certificates is compromised, WebAuthn <a>Authenticator</a>
attestation keys are still safe although their certificates can no longer be trusted. A WebAuthn Authenticator manufacturer that
has recorded the public attestation keys for their devices can issue new attestation certificates for these keys from a new
intermediate CA or from a new root CA. If the root CA changes, the [RPS] must update their trusted root certificates
accordingly.

A WebAuthn Authenticator attestation certificate must be revoked by the issuing CA if its key has been compromised. A WebAuthn
Authenticator manufacturer may need to ship a firmware update and inject new attestation keys and certificates into already
manufactured WebAuthn Authenticators, if the exposure was due to a firmware flaw. (The process by which this happens is out of
scope for this specification.) No further valid attestation statements can be made by the affected WebAuthn Authenticators
unless the WebAuthn Authenticator manufacturer has this capability.

If attestation certificate validation fails due to a revoked intermediate attestation CA certificate, and the [RP]'s policy
requires rejecting the registration/authentication request in these situations, then it is recommended that the [RP] also
un-registers (or marks as "surrogate attestation" (see [[#attestation-models]]), policy permitting) scoped credentials that were
registered post the CA compromise date using an attestation certificate chaining up to the same intermediate CA. It is thus
recommended that [RPS] remember intermediate attestation CA certificates during Authenticator registration in order to
un-register related Scoped Credentials if the registration was performed after revocation of such certificates.

If a DAA attestation key has been compromised, it can be added to the RogueList (i.e., the list of revoked authenticators)
maintained by the related DAA-Issuer. The [RP] should verify whether an authenticator belongs to the RogueList when performing
DAA-Verify. The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]] provides an easy way to access such information.


#### Attestation Certificate Hierarchy #### {#cert-hierarchy}

A 3 tier hierarchy for attestation certificates is recommended (i.e., Attestation Root, Attestation Issuing CA, Attestation
Certificate). It is also recommended that for each WebAuthn Authenticator device line (i.e., model), a separate issuing CA is
used to help facilitate isolating problems with a specific version of a device.

If the attestation root certificate is not dedicated to a single WebAuthn Authenticator device line (i.e., AAGUID), the AAGUID
must be specified either in the attestation certificate itself or as an extension in the `rawData`.


# WebAuthn Extensions # {#extensions}

The mechanism for generating scoped credentials, as well as requesting and generating WebAuthn assertions, as defined in
[[#api]], can be extended to suit particular use cases. Each case is addressed by defining a registration extension and/or a
signature extension. Extensions can define additions to the following steps and data:

- {{makeCredential()}} request parameters for registration extension.

- {{getAssertion()}} request parameters for signature extensions.

- Client processing, and the {{ClientData}} structure, for registration extensions and signature extensions.

- Authenticator processing, and the <a>authenticatorData</a> structure, for signature extensions.

When requesting an assertion for a scoped credential, a [RP] can list a set of extensions to be used, if they are supported by
the client and/or the authenticator. It sends the request parameters for each extension in the {{getAssertion()}} call (for
signature extensions) or {{makeCredential()}} call (for registration extensions) to the client platform. The client platform
performs additional processing for each extension that it supports, and augments {{ClientData}} as required by the extension.
For extensions that the client platform does not support, it passes the request parameters on to the authenticator when possible
(criteria defined below). This allows one to define extensions that affect the authenticator only.

Similarly, the authenticator performs additional processing for the extensions that it supports, and augments
|authenticatorData| as specified by the extension.

Extensions that are not supported are ignored.

All WebAuthn extensions are optional for both clients and authenticators. Thus, any extensions requested by a [RP] may be
ignored by the client browser or OS and not passed to the authenticator at all, or they may be ignored by the authenticator.
Ignoring an extension is never considered a failure in the WebAuthn API, so when [RPS] include extensions with any API calls,
they must be prepared to handle cases where some or all of those extensions are ignored.


## Extension identifiers ## {#extension-id}

Extensions are identified by a string, chosen by the extension author. Extension identifiers should aim to be globally unique,
e.g., by using reverse domain-name of the defining entity such as `com.example.webauthn.myextension`.

Extensions that may exist in multiple versions should take care to include a version in their identifier. In effect, different
versions are thus treated as different extensions.

Extensions defined in this specification use a fixed prefix of `webauthn` for the extension identifiers. This prefix should not
be used for extensions not defined by the W3C.


## Defining extensions ## {#extension-specification}

A definition of an extension must specify, at minimum, an extension identifier and an extension client argument sent via the
{{getAssertion()}} or {{makeCredential()}} call (see below). Additionally, extensions may specify additional values in
{{ClientData}}, `authenticatorData` (in the case of signature extensions), or both.

Note: An extension that does not define additions to {{ClientData}} nor `authenticatorData` is possible, but should be avoided.
    In such cases, the [RP] would have no indication whether the extension was supported or processed by the client and/or
    authenticator.


## Extending request parameters ## {#extension-request-parameters}

An extension defines two request arguments. The <dfn>client argument</dfn> is passed from the <a>[RP]</a> to the client in the
{{getAssertion()}} or {{makeCredential()}} call, while the <dfn>authenticator argument</dfn> is passed from the client to the
authenticator during the processing of these calls.

Extension definitions MUST specify the valid values for their client argument. Clients are free to ignore extensions with an
invalid client argument. Specifying an authenticator argument is optional, since some extensions may only affect client
processing.

A [RP] simultaneously requests the use of an extension and sets its client argument by including an entry in the
<a>credentialExtensions</a> or <a>assertionExtensions</a> dictionary parameters to the {{makeCredential()}} or
{{getAssertion()}} call. The entry key MUST be the extension identifier, and the value MUST be the <a>client argument</a>.

<pre class="example highlight">
    var assertionPromise = credentials.getAssertion(..., /* extensions */ {
        "com.example.webauthn.foobar": 42
    });
</pre>

Extensions that affect the behavior of the client platform can define their argument to be any set of values that can be encoded
in JSON. Such an extension will in general (but not always) specify additional values to the {{ClientData}} structure (see
below). It may also specify an authenticator argument that platforms implementing the extension are expected to send to the
authenticator. The authenticator argument should be a byte string.

Note: Extensions should aim to define authenticator arguments that are as small as possible. Some authenticators communicate
    over low-bandwidth links such as Bluetooth Low-Energy or NFC.

Note: Extensions that do not need to pass any particular argument value, must still define a client argument. It is recommended
    that the argument be defined as the constant value `true` in this case.

For extensions that specify additional authenticator processing only, it is desirable that the platform need not know the
extension. To support this, platforms SHOULD pass the client argument of unknown extension as the authenticator argument
unchanged, under the same extension identifier. The authenticator argument should be the CBOR encoding of the client argument,
as specified in Section 4.2 of [[RFC7049]]. Clients SHOULD silently drop unknown extensions whose client argument cannot be
encoded as a CBOR structure.


## Extending client processing ## {#extension-client-processing}

Extensions may define additional processing requirements on the client platform during the creation of credentials or the
generation of an assertion. In order for the <a>[RP]</a> to verify the processing took place, or if the processing has a result
value that the [RP] needs to be aware of, the extension should specify a client data value to be included in the {{ClientData}}
structure.

The value may be any value that can be encoded as a JSON value. If any extension processed by a client defines such a value, the
client SHOULD include a dictionary in {{ClientData}} with the key <a>extensions</a>. For each such extension, the client SHOULD
add an entry to this dictionary with the extension identifier as the key, and the extension's client data value.


## Extending authenticator processing with signature extensions ## {#extension-authenticator-processing}

Signature extensions that define additional authenticator processing should similarly define an authenticator data value. The
value may be any data that can be encoded as a CBOR value. An authenticator that processes a signature extension that defines
such a value must include it in the `authenticatorData`.

As specified in [[#sec-authenticator-data]], the authenticator data value of each processed extension is included in the
extended data part of the `authenticatorData`. This part is a CBOR map, with extension identifiers as keys, and the
authenticator data value of each extension as the value.


## Example extension ## {#sample-extensions}

[INFORMATIVE]

To illustrate the requirements above, consider a hypothetical extension "Geo". This extension, if supported, lets both clients
and authenticators embed their geolocation in signatures.

The extension identifier is chosen as `com.example.webauthn.geo`. The client argument is the constant value `true`, since the
extension does not require the <a>[RP]</a> to pass any particular information to the client, other than that it requests the use
of the extension. The [RP] sets this value in its request for an assertion:

<pre class="highlight">
    var assertionPromise =
        credentials.getAssertion("SGFuIFNvbG8gc2hvdCBmaXJzdC4",
            {}, /* Empty filter */
            { 'com.example.webauthn.geo': true });
</pre>

The extension defines the additional client data to be the client's location, if known, as a GeoJSON [[GeoJSON]] point. The
client constructs the following client data:

<pre class="highlight">
    {
        ...,
        'extensions': {
            'com.example.webauthn.geo': {
                'type': 'Point',
                'coordinates': [65.059962, -13.993041]
            }
        }
    }
</pre>

The extension also requires the client to set the authenticator parameter to the fixed value `1`.

Finally, the extension requires the authenticator to specify its geolocation in the authenticator data, if known. The extension
e.g. specifies that the location shall be encoded as a two-element array of floating point numbers, encoded with CBOR. An
authenticator does this by including it in the `authenticatorData`. As an example, authenticator data may be as follows
(notation taken from [[RFC7049]]):

<pre class="highlight">
    81 (hex)                                    -- Flags, ED and TUP both set.
    20 05 58 1F                                 -- Signature counter
    A1                                          -- CBOR map of one element
        6C                                      -- Key 1: CBOR text string of 12 bytes
            77 65 62 61 75 74 68 6E 2E 67 65 6F -- "webauthn.geo" UTF-8 string
        82                                      -- Value 1: CBOR array of two elements
            FA 42 82 1E B3                      -- Element 1: Latitude as CBOR encoded float
            FA C1 5F E3 7F                      -- Element 2: Longitude as CBOR encoded float
</pre>


# Pre-defined extensions # {#extension-standard}

This section defines an initial set of extensions.


## Transaction authorization ## {#extension-txauth}

This signature extension allows for a simple form of transaction authorization. A [RP] can specify a prompt string, intended for
display on a trusted device on the authenticator.

: Extension identifier
:: `webauthn.txauth.simple`

: Client argument
:: A single UTF-8 encoded string prompt.

: Client processing
:: None, except default forwarding of client argument to authenticator argument.

: Authenticator argument
:: The client argument encoded as a CBOR text string (major type 3).

: Authenticator processing
:: The authenticator MUST display the prompt to the user before performing the user verification / test of user presence. The
    authenticator may insert line breaks if needed.

: Authenticator data
:: A single UTF-8 string, representing the prompt as displayed (including any eventual line breaks).

The generic version of this extension allows images to be used as prompts as well.  This allows authenticators without a font
rendering engine to be used and also supports a richer visual appearance.

: Extension identifier
:: `webauthn.txauth.generic`

: Client argument
:: A CBOR map with one pair of data items (CBOR tagged as 0xa1). The pair of data items consists of
    1. one UTF-8 encoded string <dfn>contentType</dfn>, containing the MIME-Type of the content, e.g. "image/png"
    2. and the <dfn>content</dfn> itself, encoded as CBOR byte array.

: Client processing
:: None, except default forwarding of client argument to authenticator argument.

: Authenticator argument
:: The client argument encoded as a CBOR map.

: Authenticator processing
:: The authenticator MUST display the <a>content</a> to the user before performing the user verification / test of user
    presence. The authenticator may add other information below the <a>content</a>. No changes are allowed to the <a>content</a>
    itself, i.e., inside <a>content</a> boundary box.

: Authenticator data
:: The hash value of the <a>content</a> which was displayed. The authenticator MUST use the same hash algorithm as it uses for
    the signature itself.


## Authenticator Selection Extension ## {#extension-authenticator-selection}

This registration extension allows a [RP] to guide the selection of the authenticator that will be leveraged when creating the
credential. It is intended primarily for [RPS] that wish to tightly control the experience around credential creation.

: Extension identifier
:: `webauthn.authn-sel`

: Client argument
:: A sequence of AAGUIDs:

    <pre class="idl highlight">
        typedef sequence < AAGUID > AuthenticatorSelectionList;
    </pre>

    Each AAGUID corresponds to an authenticator attestation that is acceptable to the [RP] for this credential creation. The
    list is ordered by decreasing preference.

    An AAGUID is defined as an array containing the globally unique identifier of the authenticator attestation being sought.

    <pre class="idl highlight">
        typedef BufferSource AAGUID;
    </pre>

: Client processing
:: This extension can only be used during {{makeCredential()}}. If the client supports the Authenticator Selection Extension, it
    MUST use the first available authenticator whose AAGUID is present in the <dfn>AuthenticatorSelectionList</dfn>. If none of
    the available authenticators match a provided AAGUID, the client MUST select an authenticator from among the available
    authenticators to generate the credential.

: Authenticator argument
:: There is no authenticator argument.

: Authenticator processing
:: None.


## AAGUID Extension ## {#aaguid-extension}

: Extension identifier
:: `webauthn.aaguid`

: Client argument
:: N/A

: Client processing
:: N/A

: Authenticator argument
:: N/A

: Authenticator processing
:: This extension is added automatically by the <a>authenticator</a>.  This extension can be added to attestation statements and
    signatures.

: Authenticator data
:: A 128-bit Authenticator Attestation GUID encoded as a CBOR text string (major type 3). This AAGUID is used to identify the
    Authenticator model (Authenticator Attestation GUID).

    <div class='note'>
        Note: The authenticator model (identified by the AAGUID) can be derived from
            - here, or
            - from the attestation certificate (if we have an authenticator specific or authenticator model specific attestation
                certificate), or
            - from the claimed AAGUID in the client encoded attestation statement (if we have one attestation root certificate
                per authenticator model).

            In the case of DAA there is no need for an X.509 attestation certificate hierarchy. Instead the trust anchor being
            known to the [RP] is the DAA root key (i.e., ECPoint2 X, Y).  This root key must be dedicated to a single
            authenticator model.
    </div>


## SupportedExtensions Extension ## {#supported-extensions-extension}

: Extension identifier
:: `webauthn.exts`

: Client argument
:: N/A

: Client processing
:: N/A

: Authenticator argument
:: N/A

: Authenticator processing
:: This extension is added automatically by the authenticator.  This extension can be added to attestation statements.

: Authenticator data
:: The SupportedExtensions extension is a list (CBOR array) of extension identifiers encoded as UTF-8 Strings.


## User Verification Index (UVI) Extension ## {#uvi-extension}

: Extension identifier
:: `webauthn.uvi`

: Client argument
:: N/A

: Client processing
:: N/A

: Authenticator argument
:: N/A

: Authenticator processing
:: This extension is added automatically by the authenticator. This extension can be added to attestation statements and
    signatures.

: Authenticator data
:: The user verification index (UVI) is a value uniquely identifying a user verification data record. The UVI is encoded as CBOR
    byte string (type 0x58). Each UVI value MUST be specific to the related key (in order to provide unlinkability). It also
    must contain sufficient entropy that makes guessing impractical. UVI values MUST NOT be reused by the Authenticator (for
    other biometric data or users).

    The UVI data can be used by servers to understand whether an authentication was authorized by the exact same biometric data
    as the initial key generation. This allows the detection and prevention of "friendly fraud".

    As an example, the UVI could be computed as SHA256(KeyID | SHA256(rawUVI)), where the rawUVI reflects (a) the biometric
    reference data, (b) the related OS level user ID and (c) an identifier which changes whenever a factory reset is performed
    for the device, e.g. rawUVI = biometricReferenceData | OSLevelUserID | FactoryResetCounter.

    Servers supporting UVI extensions MUST support a length of up to 32 bytes for the UVI value.

    Example for rawData containing one UVI extension
    <pre class="highlight">
        F1 D0                                       -- This is a WebAuthn packed rawData object
        81                                          -- TUP and ED set
        00 00 00 01                                 -- (initial) signature counter
        ...                                         -- all public key alg etc.
        A1                                          -- extension: CBOR map of one element
            6C                                      -- Key 1: CBOR text string of 12 bytes

# Sample scenarios # {#sample-scenarios}

[INFORMATIVE]

In this section, we walk through some events in the lifecycle of a scoped credential, along with the corresponding sample code
for using this API. Note that this is an example flow, and does not limit the scope of how the API can be used.

As was the case in earlier sections, this flow focuses on a use case involving an external first-factor <a>authenticator</a>
with its own display. One example of such an authenticator would be a smart phone. Other authenticator types are also supported
by this API, subject to implementation by the platform. For instance, this flow also works without modification for the case of
an authenticator that is embedded in the client platform. The flow also works for the case of an external authenticator without
its own display (similar to a smart card) subject to specific implementation considerations. Specifically, the client platform
needs to display any prompts that would otherwise be shown by the authenticator, and the authenticator needs to allow the client
platform to enumerate all the authenticator's credentials so that the client can have information to show appropriate prompts.


## Registration ## {#sample-registration}

This is the first time flow, when a new credential is created and registered with the server.

1. The user visits example.com, which serves up a script. At this point, the user must already be logged in using a legacy
    username and password, or additional authenticator, or other means acceptable to the [RP].

2. The [RP] script runs the code snippet below.

3. The client platform searches for and locates the external authenticator.

4. The client platform connects to the external authenticator, performing any pairing actions if necessary.

5. The external authenticator shows appropriate UI for the user to select the authenticator on which the new credential will be
    created, and obtains a biometric or other authorization gesture from the user.

6. The external authenticator returns a response to the client platform, which in turn returns a response to the [RP] script. If
    the user declined to select an authenticator or provide authorization, an appropriate error is returned.

7. If a new credential was created,
    - The [RP] script sends the newly generated public key to the server, along with additional information about public key
        such as attestation that it is held in trusted hardware.
    - The server stores the public key in its database and associates it with the user as well as with the strength of
        authentication indicated by attestation, also storing a friendly name for later use.
    - The script may store data such as the credential ID in local storage, to improve future UX by narrowing the choice of
        credential for the user.

The sample code for generating and registering a new key follows:

<pre class="example highlight">
    var webauthnAPI = window.webauthn;

    if (!webauthnAPI) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var userAccountInformation = {
        rpDisplayName: "Acme",
        displayName: "John P. Smith",
        name: "johnpsmith@example.com",
        id: "1098237235409872",
        imageURL: "https://pics.acme.com/00/p/aBjjjpqPb.png"
    };

    // This Relying Party will accept either an ES256 or RS256 credential, but
    // prefers an ES256 credential.
    var cryptoParams = [
        {
            type: "ScopedCred",
            algorithm: "ES256"
        },
        {
            type: "ScopedCred",
            algorithm: "RS256"
        }
    ];
    var challenge = "Y2xpbWIgYSBtb3VudGFpbg";
    var timeoutSeconds = 300;  // 5 minutes
    var blacklist = [];  // No blacklist
    var extensions = {"webauthn.location": true};  // Include location information
                                                   // in attestation

    // Note: The following call will cause the authenticator to display UI.
    webauthnAPI.makeCredential(userAccountInformation, cryptoParams, challenge,
                               timeoutSeconds, blacklist, extensions)
        .then(function (newCredentialInfo) {
        // Send new credential info to server for verification and registration.
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable authenticator or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
</pre>


## Authentication ## {#sample-authentication}

This is the flow when a user with an already registered credential visits a website and wants to authenticate using the
credential.

1. The user visits example.com, which serves up a script.

2. The script asks the client platform for a WebAuthn identity assertion, providing as much information as possible to narrow
    the choice of acceptable credentials for the user. This may be obtained from the data that was stored locally after
    registration, or by other means such as prompting the user for a username.

3. The <a>[RP]</a> script runs one of the code snippets below.

4. The client platform searches for and locates the external authenticator.

5. The client platform connects to the external authenticator, performing any pairing actions if necessary.

6. The <a>external authenticator</a> presents the user with a notification that their attention is required. On opening the
    notification, the user is shown a friendly selection menu of acceptable credentials using the account information provided
    when creating the credentials, along with some information on the origin that is requesting these keys.

7. The authenticator obtains a biometric or other authorization gesture from the user.

8. The external authenticator returns a response to the client platform, which in turn returns a response to the [RP] script.
    If the user declined to select a credential or provide an authorization, an appropriate error is returned.

9. If an assertion was successfully generated and returned,
    - The script sends the assertion to the server.
    - The server examines the assertion and validates that it was correctly generated. If so, it looks up the identity
        associated with the associated public key; that identity is now authenticated. If the public key is not recognized by
        the server (e.g., deregistered by server due to inactivity) then the authentication has failed; each [RP] will handle
        this in its own way.
    - The server now does whatever it would otherwise do upon successful authentication -- return a success page, set
        authentication cookies, etc.

If the [RP] script does not have any hints available (e.g., from locally stored data) to help it narrow the list of credentials,
then the sample code for performing such an authentication might look like this:

<pre class="example highlight">
    var webauthnAPI = window.webauthn;

    if (!webauthnAPI) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var challenge = "Y2xpbWIgYSBtb3VudGFpbg";
    var timeoutSeconds = 300;  // 5 minutes
    var whitelist = [{ type: "ScopedCred" }];

    webauthnAPI.getAssertion(challenge, timeoutSeconds, whitelist)
        .then(function (assertion) {
        // Send assertion to server for verification
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable credential or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
</pre>

On the other hand, if the [RP] script has some hints to help it narrow the list of credentials, then the sample code for
performing such an authentication might look like the following. Note that this sample also demonstrates how to use the
extension for transaction authorization.

<pre class="example highlight">
    var webauthnAPI = window.webauthn;

    if (!webauthnAPI) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var challenge = "Y2xpbWIgYSBtb3VudGFpbg";
    var timeoutSeconds = 300;  // 5 minutes
    var acceptableCredential1 = {
        type: "ScopedCred",
        id: "ISEhISEhIWhpIHRoZXJlISEhISEhIQo="
    };
    var acceptableCredential2 = {
        type: "ScopedCred",
        id: "cm9zZXMgYXJlIHJlZCwgdmlvbGV0cyBhcmUgYmx1ZQo="
    };
    var whitelist = [acceptableCredential1, acceptableCredential2];
    var extensions = { 'webauthn.txauth.simple':
                       "Wave your hands in the air like you just don't care" };

    webauthnAPI.getAssertion(challenge, timeoutSeconds, whitelist, extensions)
        .then(function (assertion) {
        // Send assertion to server for verification
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable credential or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
</pre>


## Decommissioning ## {#sample-decommissioning}

The following are possible situations in which decommissioning a credential might be desired. Note that all of these are
handled on the server side and do not need support from the API specified here.

- Possibility #1 -- user reports the credential as lost.
    * User goes to server.example.net, authenticates and follows a link to report a lost/stolen device.
    * Server returns a page showing the list of registered credentials with friendly names as configured during registration.
    * User selects a credential and the server deletes it from its database.
    * In future, the <a>[RP]</a> script does not specify this credential in any list of acceptable credentials, and assertions
        signed by this credential are rejected.

- Possibility #2 -- server deregisters the credential due to inactivity.
    * Server deletes credential from its database during maintenance activity.
    * In the future, the [RP] script does not specify this credential in any list of acceptable credentials, and assertions
        signed by this credential are rejected.

- Possibility #3 -- user deletes the credential from the device.
    * User employs a device-specific method (e.g., device settings UI) to delete a credential from their device.
    * From this point on, this credential will not appear in any selection prompts, and no assertions can be generated with it.
    * Sometime later, the server deregisters this credential due to inactivity.

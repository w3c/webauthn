      <p>FIDO specifications support
	different user verification methods (PIN based, fingerprint based, etc.) and 
	authenticator implementations, e.g. in 
	a rich operating system, in a trusted execution environments (TEE) or in a secure element/TPM.
	The resulting authentication strength depends on the user verification method and the 
	protection mechanisms implemented by the authenticator.  
      </p>
      <p>FIDO uses the concept of attestation to provide a cryptographic proof of the authenticator
	model to the relying party.  The relying party can derive the authenticator security 
	characteristics from this proof.
      </p>      
      <p>This specification defines generic data structures that cover the
	semantics of FIDO Authenticator attestation. This specification also 
	provides a profile of these structures when a TPM [[TPM]] acts as a crypto kernel. 
	More profiles are expected to be added as the specification
	evolves.

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <section>
	<h3>Attestation Models</h3>
      
	<p>FIDO 2.0 specifies multiple attestation models:</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>Full Basic Attestation</dt>
	  <dd>In the case of full basic attestation [[UAFProtocol]], the Authenticator's attestation private key is
	    specific to an Authenticator model.  That means that an Authenticator of the same model
	    typically shares the same attestation private key.
	    <p>This model is also used for FIDO UAF 1.0 and FIDO U2F 1.0.</p>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>Surrogate Basic Attestation</dt>
	  <dd>In the case of surrogate basic attestation [[UAFProtocol]], the 
	    Authenticator doesn't have any specific attestation key.  Instead it uses 
	    the authentication key to (self-)sign the (surrogate) attestation message.  
	    Authenticators without meaningful protection measures for an attestation private key
	    typically use this attestation model.  
	  </dd>
	  <dt>Privacy CA</dt>
	  <dd>In this case, the authenticator owns an authenticator-specific (endorsement) key.  
	    This key is used to securely communicate with a trusted third party, 
	    the Privacy CA.  The Authenticator can generate
	    multiple attestation key pairs and asks the Privacy CA to issue an 
	    attestation certificate for it. 
	    <p>Using this approach, the Authenticator can limit the exposure of the 
	      endorsement key (which is a global correlation handle) to Privacy CA(s).
	      Attestation keys can be requested for each FIDO credential individually.
	    </p>
	    <p class="note">This concept typically leads to multiple attestation certificates.
	      The attestation certificate requested most recently is called "active".
	    </p>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA)</dt>
	  <dd>In this case, the Authenticator receives DAA credentials from a single DAA-Issuer.
	    These DAA credentials are used along with blinding to sign the attestation data.
	    The concept of blinding avoids the DAA credentials being misused as global correlation handle.
	    <p>FIDO 2.0 supports DAA using elliptic curve cryptography and bilinear pairings, 
	      called ECDAA (see [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]) in this specification.</p>
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Compliant FIDO Servers MUST support all attestation models.  
	  Authenticators can choose what attestation model to implement.
	</p>
	<p class="note">Relying parties can always decide what attestation models are acceptable by policy.
	</p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>Contextual Data</h3>

	<p>FIDO 2.0 attestation statements are bound to various contextual data. These data are
	  observed, and added at different levels of the stack as a signature request
	  passes from the server to the authenticator. In verifying a signature, the
	  server checks these bindings against expected values.</p>
	
	<p>These components can be divided into three layers:</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>The relying party (RP) consists of two subcomponents: an online
	    service and a client-side application. The client-side app may, for
	    example, be a web application running in a browser, or a native application
	    that runs directly on the OS platform.</li>
	  <li>The client platform, which consists of the user’s OS and device used to
	    host the RP’s client-side app. For web applications, the browser also belongs
	    to this layer.</li>
	  <li>The authenticator itself, which provides key generation and key management and
	    cryptographic signatures.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The goals of this design can be summarized as follows.
	  <ul>
	    <li>The scheme for generating keys and attestation statements should accommodate cases where the
	      link between the client platform and authenticator is very limited, in
	      bandwidth and/or latency. Examples include Bluetooth Low Energy and Near-Field
	      Communication.</li>
	    <li>The data processed by the authenticator should be small and easy to
	      interpret in low-level code. In particular, authenticators should not have to
	      parse high-level encodings such as JSON.</li>
	    <li>Both the client platform and the authenticator should have the flexibility
	      to add contextual bindings, as needed.</li>
	    <li>The design aims to reuse existing encoding formats as much as possible
	      to aid adoption and implementation.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  There are two kinds of contextual bindings:
	  Those added by the RP or the client platform,
	  referred to as <dfn>client data</dfn> (see [[!FIDOSignatureFormat]])
	  and those added by the
	  authenticator, referred to as the <dfn>attestation data</dfn>.  The client
	  data must be signed over, but an authenticator is otherwise not interested in
	  its contents.  More specifically, the authenticator cannot attest to the correctness of such data.
	  To save bandwidth and processing requirements on the
	  authenticator, the client platform hashes the client data and sends only
	  the hash result to the authenticator. The authenticator attestation statement includes the combination
	  of this hash, and its own attestation data.
	</p>

      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>Attestation Raw Data Types</h3>

	<p>
	  FIDO specifies pluggable attestation raw data types, i.e., 
	  ways to serialize the data being attested to by the authenticator.
	  The reason is to be able to support existing devices like TPMs and other
	  platform-specific formats.
	</p>
	<p>Each attestation type provides the ability to cryptographically attest to a public key, the
	  authenticator model, and contextual data to a remote party.
	</p>
	<p>Attestation raw data types are orthogonal to attestation models, i.e. 
	  attestation raw data types in general are not restricted to a single attestation model.
	</p>
	
      </section>
      
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Attestation Statement</h2>
      <p>When an attestation statement is required for an Authenticator, the client
	needs to ask the Authenticator to generate one. This section describes the
	attestation statement data structures. Attestation statements
	can also include some host and other Authenticator information.
      </p>
      
      The attestation statement consists of
      <ol>
	<li>the <code>header</code> object, containing the signing algorithm and 
	  additional information required to verify the attestation signature.
	</li>
	<li>the <code>core</code> object, containing the attested data.  This object
	  is a container and can carry multiple, authenticator model specific, 
	  attestation rawData types (see section <a href='#defined-attestation-raw-data-types'></a>). 
	</li>
	<li>the <code>signature</code> object.  This object contains the cryptographic
	  signature computed over the <code>rawData</code> object.  
	  The structure of this object depends on the signature algorithm.
	</li>
      </ol>
      
      <section>
	<h2>Client encoding of attestation statements</h2>

	<p>The client platform uses an authenticator generated 
	  attestation signature (<code>signature</code>) and the 
	  authenticator generated <code>rawData</code> object to construct
	  the final attestation statement object (which will be returned to the RP). 
	  This attestation statement is encoded as:
	</p>

	<dl class='idl' title='interface AttestationStatement'>
	  <dt>readonly attribute AttestationHeader header</dt>
	  <dd>Attestation header, including algorithm, (optionally) the claimed AAGUID 
	    and (optionally) the attestation certificate chain.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>readonly attribute AttestationCore core</dt>
	  <dd>AttestationCore object.  This object includes the attested <code>rawData</code> and 
	    its <code>type</code> and <code>version</code>.</dd>
	  <dt>readonly attribute DOMString signature</dt>
	  <dd>The base64url-encoded attestation signature.  The structure of this 
	    object depends on the signature algorithm specified in the header.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p>This attestation statement is delivered to the RP according to the Client API.
	  It contains all the information that the RP's FIDO server requires to
	  reconstruct the signature base string, as well as to decode and validate
	  the bindings of both the client- and authenticator data.
	</p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>AttestationCore</h3>
	Data attested by the Authenticator and description of its structure.
	Different types of Authenticators might generate different object types 
	(identified by <code>type</code> and <code>version</code>).

	<dl class='idl' title='interface AttestationCore'>
	  <dt>readonly attribute DOMString type</dt>
	  <dd>
	    The type of the rawData object. This specification defines these
	    attestation raw data types: "tpm", "packed", and "android". Other attestation
	    raw data types may be defined in further versions of this specification.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>readonly attribute unsigned long version</dt>
	  <dd>The version number of the rawData object.</dd>
	  <dt>readonly attribute DOMString rawData</dt>
	  <dd>
	    The rawData object (for type "android"), or the base64url-encoded rawData
	    object (for types "tpm" and "packed"), containing the attested public key
	    and the <code>clientDataHash</code>.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>readonly attribute DOMString clientData</dt>
	  <dd>
	    A base64url encoding of clientDataJSON [[!FIDOSignatureFormat]]. The
	    exact encoding must be preserved as the hash (clientDataHash) has been
	    computed over it.
	  </dd>
	</dl>

	<section>
	  <h4>Client data</h4>	  
	  <p>
	    The client platform SHALL deliver, through the EAP API, the
	    <code>clientDataHash</code> (see [[!FIDOSignatureFormat]]) to the authenticator.  
	    The client platform MUST also preserve the exact <code>encodedClientData</code> 
	    string (see [[!FIDOSignatureFormat]]), for embedding
	    in a signature object sent back to the RP. This is necessary since multiple
	    JSON encodings of the same client data are possible.
	  </p>
	</section>

      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>AttestationHeader</h3>
	Additional data required to verify the attestation signature.  

	<dl class='idl' title='interface AttestationHeader'>
	  <dt>readonly attribute DOMString claimedAAGUID</dt>
	  <dd>The claimed Authenticator Attestation GUID (a version 4 GUID, see [[RFC4122]]).  
	    This value is used by the FIDO Server to 
	    lookup the trust anchor for verifying this AttestationCore object.  
	    If the verification succeeds, 
	    the AAGUID related to the trust anchor is trusted.  This field MUST be present, if either no
	    attestation certificates are used (e.g., DAA) or if the attestation 
	    certificate doesn't contain the AAGUID value in an extension.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>readonly attribute DOMString[] x5c</dt>
	  <dd>Attestation Certificate and its certificate chain as described
	    in [[!RFC7515]] section 4.1.6.</dd>
	  <dt>readonly attribute DOMString alg</dt>
	  <dd>The name of the algorithm used to generate the attestation signature according to [[!RFC7518]].  
	    <p>See section <a href='#attestationsignature'></a> for the signature algorithms 
	      to be implemented by FIDO Servers.</p>
	  </dd>
	</dl>

      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>Defined Attestation Raw Data Types</h3>
	
	<p>
	  Attestation Raw Data (<code>rawData</code>) is the to-be-signed object of
	  the attestation statement. FIDO supports pluggable attestation data types.
	  This allows support of TPM generated attestation data as well as support of
	  other FIDO authenticators.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The contents of the attestation data must be controlled (i.e., generated or
	  at least verified) by the authenticator itself.
	</p>
	<section>
	  <h4>Packed Attestation</h4>
	  Packed attestation is a FIDO optimized format of attestation data.  It uses a very compact but 
	  still extensible encoding method.  Encoding this format can even be implemented by authenticators
	  with very limited resources (e.g., secure elements).

	  <section>
	    <h5>Attestation rawData (type="packed")</h5>
	    
	    <p>The attestation data encodes contextual bindings made by the
	      authenticator itself. Unlike client data, the authenticator data has
	      a compact but extensible encoding. This is desired since authenticators can
	      be devices with limited capabilities and low power requirements, with much
	      simpler software stacks than the client platform components.</p>

	    <p>For this type, only version="1" is defined at this time.</p>

	    <p>The field <code>rawData</code> is the <b>base64url encoding of the byte array</b>.
	      The encoding of attestation data (for type "packed") is a byte array 
	      of 45 bytes + length of public key + length of KeyHandle + potentially more extensions. 
	      The first bytes before the extensions have a fixed layout as follows:</p>
	    <table class="simple">
	      <tr>
		<th>Length (in bytes)</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>0xF1D0, fixed big-endian TAG to make sure this object won't be 
		  confused with other (non-FIDO) binary objects.</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<td>1</td>

        <h4>Android Attestation</h4>
        <p>
          When the Authenticator in question is a platform-provided
          Authenticator on the Android platform, the attestation statement is
          based on the <a href='https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response'>
	    SafetyNet API</a>.
        </p>
	
	<p>Android attestation statement MUST always be used in conjunction with the more 
	  specific <code>AndroidAttestationClientData</code> (see section <a href='#androidattestationclientdata'></a>)
	  in order to let the RP App store the public key in the attestation object.
	</p>

	<section>
	  <h5>Attestation rawData (type="android")</h5>
	  <p>
	    Android SafetyNet returns a JWS [[RFC7515]] object (see 
	    <a href='https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response'>
	      SafetyNet online documentation</a>) in Compact
	    Serialization. A JWS in Compact Serialization consists of three segments
	    (each a base64url-encoded string) separated by a dot ("."). The
	    <code>rawData</code> object is the concatenation of:    
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>the first segment (a base64url encoding of the UTF-8 encoded JWS Protected Header)</li>
	    <li>a dot "."</li>
	    <li>the second segment (a base64url encoding of the UTF-8 encoded JWS Payload).</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>
	    In contrast to the "packed" and "tpm" attestation types, for the
	    "android" attestation type, the <code>rawData</code> field and the
	    <code>rawData</code> object are the same string. (In the "packed" and
	    "tpm" attestation types the <code>rawData</code> field is the
	    base64url-encoding of the <code>rawData</code> object.)
	  </p>
	</section>	  

	<section>
	  <h5>Signature</h5>
	  <p>
	    The signature is directly computed over the <code>rawData</code> field, as
	    defined above (see [[RFC7515]] for more details). The third segment of the
	    JWS returned by SafetyNet is the base64url encoding of this signature,
	    and also becomes the <code>AttestationStatement.signature</code>.
	  </p>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h5>Converting SafetyNet response to attestationStatement</h5>
	  <p>
	    The Authenticator and/or platform SHOULD use the steps outlined below to
	    create an attestationStatement from an Android SafetyNet response. It MAY
	    use a different algorithm, as long as the results are the same.
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>create clientDataJSON with type AndroidAttestationClientData (see below) and 
	      compute clientData as base64url-encoded clientDataJSON.</li>
	    <li>provide the clientDataHash computed as the hash value of clientData 
	      as Nonce value when requesting the SafetyNet attestation.</li>

	<h3>Verifying an Attestation Statement</h3>
	<p>This section outlines the recommended algorithm for verifying an
	  attestation statement, independent of attestation type.
	</p>
	<p>Upon receiving an attestation statement, the relying party
	  shall:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Verify that the attestation statement is properly formatted</li>
	  <li>If <code>attestationSignature.alg</code> is not ECDAA (e.g., not "ED256" and not "ED512"): 
	    <ol>
	      <li>Lookup the attestation root certificate from a trusted source.  
		The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]]
		provides an easy way to access such information.
		The <code>header.claimedAAGUID</code>
		can be used for this lookup.
	      </li>
	      <li>Verify that 
		the attestation certificate chain is valid and
		chains up to a trusted root (following [[RFC5280]]).
	      </li>
	      <li>Verify that the attestation certificate has the right Extended Key Usage (EKU) based
		on the FIDO Authenticator type (as denoted by the <code>header.type</code> member). In case of a
		type="tpm", this EKU shall be OID "2.23.133.8.3".
	      </li>
	      <li>If the attestation type is "android", verify that the attestation certificate is issued 
	          to the hostname "attest.android.com" (see 
		<a href='https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response'>
	          SafetyNet online documentation</a>).
	      </li>
	      <li>Verify that all issuing CA certificates in the chain are valid
		and not revoked.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Verify the <code>signature</code> on <code>core.rawData</code> using the
		attestation certificate public key and algorithm as identified by <code>header.alg</code>.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		Verify <code>core.rawData</code> syntax and that it doesn't contradict the signing 
		algorithm specified in <code>header.alg</code>.
	      </li>
	      <li>If the attestation certificate contains an extension with 
		OID <code>1 3 6 1 4 1 45724 1 1 4</code>
		(id-fido-gen-ce-aaguid) verify that the value of this extension matches 
		<code>header.claimedAAGUID</code>.  This identifies the Authenticator model.
	      </li>
	      <li>If such extension doesn't exist, 
		the attestation root certificate is dedicated to a single Authenticator model.
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>If <code>attestationSignature.alg</code> is ECDAA (e.g., "ED256", "ED512"):
	    <ol>
	      <li>Lookup the DAA 
		root key from a trusted source.  The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]]
		provides an easy way to access such information.
		The <code>header.claimedAAGUID</code>
		can be used for this lookup.	    
	      </li>
	      <li>Perform DAA-Verify on <code>signature</code> 
		for <code>core.rawData</code> (see [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).</li>
	      <li>
		Verify <code>core.rawData</code> syntax and that it doesn't contradict the signing 
		algorithm specified in <code>header.alg</code>.
	      </li>
	      <li>The DAA root key is dedicated to a single Authenticator model.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Verify the contextual bindings (e.g., channel binding) from the 
	    clientData (see Section <a href='#client-data'></a>).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Verify that user verification method and other authenticator characteristics 
	    related to this authenticator model, match the relying party policy.
	    The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]]
	    provides an easy way to access the authenticator characteristics.
	  </li>
	</ol>

	The relying party MAY take any of the below actions when
	verification of an attestation statement fails:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Reject the request, such as a registration request, associated
	    with the attestation statement.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Accept the request associated with the attestation statement but
	    treat the attested FIDO Credential as one with surrogate basic 
	    attestation (see <a href='#attestation-models'></a>), if policy allows it.
	    If doing so, there is no cryptographic proof that the FIDO Credential 
	    has been generated by a particular Authenticator model.  
	    See [[FIDOSecRef]] and [[UAFProtocol]] for more details on the relevance on attestation.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Verification of attestation statements requires that the relying
	  party trusts the root of the attestation certificate chain.
	  Also, the relying party must have access to certificate status
	  information for the intermediate CA certificates. The relying
	  party must also be able to build the attestation certificate
	  chain if the client didn't provide this chain in the
	  attestation information.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2> 
      
      <section>
	<h3>Privacy</h3>
	
	<p>Attestation keys may be used to track users or link
	  various online identities of the same user together. This may
	  be mitigated in several ways, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A FIDO Authenticator manufacturer may choose to ship all of their devices with
	    the same (or a fixed number of) attestation key(s) (called Full Basic Attestation). This will
	    anonymize the user at the risk of not being able to revoke a
	    particular attestation key should its FIDO Authenticator be compromised.
	  </li>
	  <li>A FIDO Authenticator may be capable of dynamically generating different attestation keys
	    (and requesting related certificates) per origin (following the Privacy CA model). 
	    For example, a FIDO Authenticator can ship with a master 
	    attestation key (and certificate), and
	    combined with a cloud operated privacy CA, can dynamically generate per origin
	    attestation keys and attestation certificates.
	  </li>
	  <li>A FIDO Authenticator can implement direct anonymous 
	    attestation (see [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).  Using this scheme the authenticator
	    generates a blinded attestation signature.  This allows the relying party to verify 
	    the signature using the DAA root key, but the attestation signature doesn't 
	    serve as a global correlation handle.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3>Attestation Certificate and Attestation Certificate CA Compromise</h3>
	<p>When an intermediate CA or a root CA used for issuing attestation
	  certificates is compromised, FIDO Authenticator attestation keys are still
	  safe although their certificates can no longer be trusted. A
	  FIDO Authenticator manufacturer that has recorded the public attestation keys
	  for their devices can issue new attestation certificates for
	  these keys from a new intermediate CA or from a new root CA.
	  If the root CA changes, the relying parties must update their trusted 
	  root certificates accordingly.
	</p>
	<p>A FIDO Authenticator attestation certificate must be revoked by the issuing CA
	  if its key has been compromised. A FIDO Authenticator manufacturer may need to
	  ship a firmware update and inject new attestation keys and
	  certificates into already manufactured FIDO Authenticators, if
	  the exposure was due to a firmware flaw.
	  (The process by which this happens is out of scope for this specification.)
	  No further valid
	  attestation statements can be made by the affected FIDO Authenticators unless
	  the FIDO Authenticator manufacturer has this capability.
	</p>
	<p>If attestation certificate validation fails due to a revoked
	  intermediate attestation CA certificate, and relying party policy requires rejecting
	  the registration/authentication request in these situations,
	  then it is recommended that the relying party also un-registers
	  (or marks as "surrogate attestation" (see <a href='#attestation-models'></a>), policy permitting) 
	  FIDO credentials that were registered post the CA compromise date using an attestation
	  certificate chaining up to the same intermediate CA. It is thus
	  recommended that relying parties remember intermediate attestation CA certificates
	  during Authenticator registration in order to un-register related FIDO Credentials if 
	  the registration was performed after revocation of such certificates.
	</p>
	
	<p>If a DAA attestation key has been compromised, it can be added to the
	  RogueList (i.e., the list of revoked authenticators) maintained by the related DAA-Issuer.
	  The relying party should verify whether an authenticator belongs to the
	  RogueList when performing DAA-Verify.  The FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]]
	  provides an easy way to access such information.
	</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
	<h3>Attestation Certificate Hierarchy</h3>
	<p>A 3 tier hierarchy for attestation certificates is recommended 
	  (i.e., Attestation Root, Attestation Issuing CA, Attestation Certificate). 
	  It is also recommended that
	  for each FIDO Authenticator device line (i.e., model), a separate issuing CA is used to help
	  facilitate isolating problems with a specific version of a device.
	</p>
	<p>If the attestation root certificate is <em>not</em> dedicated 
	  to a single FIDO Authenticator device line (i.e., AAGUID),
	  the AAGUID must be specified either in the attestation certificate itself or 
	  as an extension in the <code>core.rawData</code>.

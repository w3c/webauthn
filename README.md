# Contributing

To materially contribute to this specification, you must meet the requiements outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md). Also, before submitting feedback, please familiarize yourself with [our current issues list](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues) and review the [mailing list discussion](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webauthn/).

# Building the Draft

Formatted HTML for the draft can be built using `bikeshed` (see below for instructions for `bikeshed` installation):

```
$ bikeshed spec
```

You may also want to use the `watch` functionality to automatically regenerate as you make changes:

```
$ bikeshed watch
```

# Bikeshed Installation and Setup

You will need to have the Python tools `pygments` and `bikeshed` to build the draft. Pygments can be obtained via `pip`, but Bikeshed will need to be downloaded with `git`:

```
git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git ./bikeshed
pip install pygments
pip install --editable ./bikeshed
cp -R .spec-data/* ./bikeshed/bikeshed/spec-data
```

# Continuous Integration & Branches

This repository uses `.deploy-output.sh` to generate the Editor's Draft on the `gh-pages` branch upon every merge to `master`. In order to prevent failed merges during continuous integration, the formatted Editor's Draft should not be checked in to `master`, and it is in the `.gitignore` file.

# Creating a new Working Draft

To build a new WD and upload it to the W3C publishing system:
- Make sure Bikeshed is installed locally
- Edit the Bikeshed metadata to change the status from ED to WD (do not commit this change)
- Build and upload the new draft with
```
bikeshed echidna -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -d DECISION_URL
```

This will create a tarball of the HTML and images, and upload to Echidna. Status of the request can be tracked through the W3C API [as described in the Echidna documentation](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna).

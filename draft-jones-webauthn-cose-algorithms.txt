           COSE Algorithms for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)
                draft-jones-webauthn-cose-algorithms-00

Abstract

   The W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) specification uses COSE
   algorithm identifiers.  This specification registers algorithms in
   the IANA "COSE Algorithms" registry that are used by WebAuthn that
   are not already registered.  Also, they are registered in the IANA
   "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry, when not
   already registered there.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines how to use several algorithms with COSE
   [RFC8152] that are used by the W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn)
   [WebAuthn] specification.  These algorithms are registered in the
   IANA "COSE Algorithms" registry [IANA.COSE.Algorithms] and also in
   the IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry
   [IANA.JOSE.Algorithms], when not already registered there.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 Signature Algorithm

   The RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm is defined in [RFC8017].
   The RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 signature algorithm is parameterized with a
   hash function (h).

   A key of size 2048 bits or larger MUST be used with these algorithms.
   Implementations need to check that the key type is 'RSA' when
   creating or verifying a signature.

   The RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms specified in this document are in
   the following table.

   +-------+-------------------------+---------+-----------------------+

   | RS1   | TBD (requested          | SHA-1   | RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 w/  |
   |       | assignment -262)        |         | SHA-1                 |

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  COSE Algorithms Registrations

   This section registers the following values in the IANA "COSE
   Algorithms" registry [IANA.COSE.Algorithms].

   o  Name: RS256
   o  Value: TBD (requested assignment -257)
   o  Description: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 w/ SHA-256
   o  Reference: Section 2 of this document
   o  Recommended: No

   o  Name: RS384
   o  Value: TBD (requested assignment -258)
   o  Description: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 w/ SHA-384
   o  Reference: Section 2 of this document
   o  Recommended: No

   o  Name: RS512
   o  Value: TBD (requested assignment -259)
   o  Description: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 w/ SHA-512
   o  Reference: Section 2 of this document
   o  Recommended: No

   o  Name: RS1
   o  Value: TBD (requested assignment -262)
   o  Description: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 w/ SHA-1
   o  Reference: Section 2 of this document
   o  Recommended: No

4.  Security Considerations

4.1.  RSA Key Size Security Considerations

   The security considerations on key sizes for RSA algorithms from
   Section 6.1 of [RFC8230] also apply to the RSA algorithms in this
   specification.

4.2.  RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-2 Security Considerations

   The security considerations on the use of RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with
   SHA-2 hash functions from Section 8.3 of [RFC7518] also apply to
   their use in this specification.  For that reason, these algorithms
   are registered as being "Not Recommended".

4.3.  RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with SHA-1 Security Considerations

   The security considerations on the use of the SHA-1 hash function
   from [RFC6194] apply in this specification.  For that reason, the
   "RS1" algorithm is registered as "Not Recommended".  It MUST NOT be
   used by COSE implementations.

   A COSE algorithm identifier for this algorithm is nonetheless being
   registered because deployed TPMs continue to use it, and therefore
   WebAuthn implementations need a COSE algorithm identifier for "RS1"
   when TPM attestations using this algorithm are being represented.

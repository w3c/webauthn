1.  Introduction

   This specification establishes IANA registries for W3C Web
   Authentication [WebAuthn] attestation statement format identifiers
   and extension identifiers.  The initial values for these registries
   are in the IANA Considerations section of the [WebAuthn]
   specification.

2.  WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier Registry

   WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers are strings whose
   semantic, syntactic, and string-matching criteria are specified in
   [WebAuthn] Section 8.1 "Attestation Statement Format Identifiers"
   [1], along with the concepts of attestation and attestation statement
   formats.

   WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers are registered on
   the advice of a Designated Expert (appointed by the IESG or their
   delegate), with a Specification Required (per [RFC5226]).

   The Expert(s) will establish procedures for requesting registrations,
   and make them available from the registry page.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier: This identifier
      MUST be a maximum of 32 octets in length and MUST consist only of
      printable USASCII characters, excluding backslash and doublequote.
      This name is case sensitive.  Names may not match other registered

      names in a case-insensitive manner unless the Designated Experts
      state that there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.
   o  Description: A relatively short description of the attestation
      format.
   o  Specification Document: Reference to the specification of the
      attestation statement format.
   o  Notes: [optional]

   The Expert(s) MAY define additional fields to be collected in the
   registry.  Each attestation statement format identifier added to this
   registry MUST be unique amongst the set of registered attestation
   statement format identifiers.  The Experts(s) MAY also designate
   attestation statement formats as proprietary if they lack complete
   specifications, and will assign a prefix indicating as such to the
   identifier.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available specification, e.g.,
   as described in [RFC2026] Section 7.

   Note that WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers can be
   registered by third parties, if the Expert(s) determine that an
   unregistered attestation statement format is widely deployed and not
   likely to be registered in a timely manner.

   Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be
   first appealed to Application Area Directors (contactable using app-
   ads@tools.ietf.org email address or directly by looking up their
   email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) and, if the
   appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the full IESG (using
   the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).

2.1.  Initial WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier Registry
      Values

   The initial values for the WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format
   Identifier Registry are to be populated from the values listed in
   Section 11.1 "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier
   Registrations" [2] of [WebAuthn].

3.  WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry

   WebAuthn extension identifiers are strings whose semantic, syntactic,
   and string-matching criteria are specified in [WebAuthn] Section 9.1
   "Extension Identifiers" [3].

   WebAuthn extension identifiers are registered on the advice of a
   Designated Expert (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a
   Specification Required (per [RFC5226]).

   The Expert(s) will establish procedures for requesting registrations,
   and make them available from the registry page.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  WebAuthn Extension Identifier: This identifier MUST be a maximum
      of 32 octets in length and MUST consist only of printable USASCII
      characters, excluding backslash and doublequote.  This name is
      case sensitive.  Names may not match other registered names in a
      case-insensitive manner unless the Designated Experts state that
      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.
   o  Description: A relatively short description of the extension.
   o  Specification Document: Reference to the specification of the
      extension.
   o  Notes: [optional]

   The Expert(s) MAY define additional fields to be collected in the
   registry.  Each extension identifier added to this registry MUST be
   unique amongst the set of registered extension identifiers.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available specification, e.g.,
   as described in [RFC2026] Section 7.

   Note that WebAuthn extensions can be registered by third parties, if
   the Expert(s) determine that an unregistered extension is widely
   deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely manner.

   Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be
   first appealed to Application Area Directors (contactable using app-
   ads@tools.ietf.org email address or directly by looking up their
   email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) and, if the
   appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the full IESG (using
   the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).

3.1.  Initial WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry Values

   The initial values for the WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry are
   to be populated from the values listed in Section 11.2 "WebAuthn
   Extension Identifier Registrations" [4] of [WebAuthn].

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier and Extension
      Identifiers Registries

   This specification establishes two registries:





Hodges, et al.         Expires September 12, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)    March 2019


   o  the "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier" registry;
      see Section 2.
   o  the "WebAuthn Extension Identifier" registry; see Section 3.

   For both registries, the Expert(s) and IANA will interact as outlined
   below:

   IANA will direct any incoming requests regarding the registry to the
   processes established by the Expert(s); typically, this will mean
   referring them to the registry HTML page.

   The Expert(s) will provide registry data to IANA in an agreed form
   (e.g., a specific XML format).  IANA will publish:

   o  The raw registry data
   o  The registry data, transformed into HTML
   o  The registry data in any alternative formats provided by the
      Expert(s)

   Each published document will be at a URL agreed to by IANA and the
   Expert(s) and IANA will set HTTP response headers on them as
   (reasonably) requested by the Expert(s).

   Additionally, the HTML generated by IANA will:

   o  Take directions from the Expert(s) as to the content of the HTML
      page's introductory text and markup.
   o  Include a stable HTML fragment identifier for each registered
      attestation statement format identifier or extension identifier.

   All registry data documents MUST include Simplified BSD License text
   as described in Section 4.e of the Trust Legal Provisions
   (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).

5.  Security Considerations

   See [WebAuthn] for relevant security considerations.

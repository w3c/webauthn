1.  Introduction

   This specification establishes IANA registries for W3C Web
   Authentication [WebAuthn] attestation statement format identifiers
   and extension identifiers.  The initial values for these registries

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)      Oct 2019


   are in the IANA Considerations section of the [WebAuthn]
   specification.

2.  WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier Registry

   WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers are strings whose
   semantic, syntactic, and string-matching criteria are specified in
   [WebAuthn] "Attestation Statement Format Identifiers" [5], along with
   the concepts of attestation and attestation statement formats.

   Registered attestation statement format identifiers are those that
   have been added to the registry by following the procedure in
   Section 2.1.

   Each attestation statement format identifier added to this registry
   MUST be unique amongst the set of registered attestation statement
   format identifiers.  The Experts(s) MAY also designate attestation
   statement formats as proprietary if they lack complete
   specifications, and will assign a prefix indicating as such to the
   identifier.

   Registered attestation statement format identifiers MUST be a maximum
   of 32 octets in length and MUST consist only of printable USASCII
   characters, excluding backslash and doublequote, i.e., VCHAR as
   defined in [RFC5234] but without %x22 and %x5c.  Attestation
   statement format identifiers are case sensitive.  Attestation
   statement format identifiers may not match other registered
   identifiers in a case-insensitive manner unless the Designated
   Experts determine that there is a compelling reason to allow an
   exception.

2.1.  Registering Attestation Statement Format Identifiers

   WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers are registered
   using the Specification Required policy (see Section 4.6 of
   [RFC8126]), which implies review and approval by a designated expert.

   The WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers registry is
   located at https://www.iana.org/assignments/(fill-in-here-per-IANA)/
   [6].  Registration requests can be made by following the instructions
   located there, or by sending an e-mail to the "public-
   webauthn@w3.org" mailing list.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  *WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier*: An identifier
      meeting the requirements given above in Section 2.




Hodges, et al.           Expires April 20, 2020                 [Page 3]

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)      Oct 2019


   o  *Description*: A relatively short description of the attestation
      format.
   o  *Reference*: Reference to the specification of the attestation
      statement format.
   o  Notes: [optional]

   The expert(s) can define additional fields to be collected in the
   registry.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available, stable
   specification, e.g., as described in Section 7 of [RFC2026].

   Note that WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers can be
   registered by third parties (including the expert(s) themselves), if
   the expert(s) determine that an unregistered attestation statement
   format is widely deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely
   manner otherwise.  Such registrations still are subject to the
   requirements defined, including the need to reference a
   specification.

2.2.  Registration Request Processing

   As noted in Section 2.1, WebAuthn attestation statement format
   identifiers are registered using the Specification Required policy,
   implying review and approval by a designated expert.

   The expert(s) will clearly identify any issues which cause a
   registration to be refused.

   When a request is approved, the expert(s) will inform IANA, and the
   registration will be processed.  The IESG is the final arbiter of any
   objection.

2.3.  Initial WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier Registry
      Values

   The initial values for the WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format
   Identifier Registry are to be populated from the values listed in
   "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier Registrations" [7]
   of [WebAuthn].

3.  WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry

   WebAuthn extension identifiers are strings whose semantic, syntactic,
   and string-matching criteria are specified in [WebAuthn] "Extension
   Identifiers" [8].

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)      Oct 2019


   Registered extension identifiers are those that have been added to
   the registry by following the procedure in Section 3.1.

   Each extension identifier added to this registry MUST be unique
   amongst the set of registered extension identifiers.

   Registered extension identifiers MUST be a maximum of 32 octets in
   length and MUST consist only of printable USASCII characters,
   excluding backslash and doublequote, i.e., VCHAR as defined in
   [RFC5234] but without %x22 and %x5c.  Extension identifiers are case
   sensitive.  Extension identifiers may not match other registered
   names in a case-insensitive manner unless the Designated Experts
   determine that there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.

3.1.  Registering Extension Identifiers

   WebAuthn extension identifiers registry are registered using the
   Specification Required policy (see Section 4.6 of [RFC8126]), which
   implies review and approval by a designated expert.

   The WebAuthn extension identifiers registry is located at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/(fill-in-here-per-IANA)/ [9].
   Registration requests can be made by following the instructions
   located there, or by sending an e-mail to the "public-
   webauthn@w3.org" mailing list.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  *WebAuthn Extension Identifier*: An identifier meeting the
      requirements given above in Section 3.
   o  *Description*: A relatively short description of the extension.
   o  *Reference*: Reference to the specification of the extension.
   o  Notes: [optional]

   The expert(s) can define additional fields to be collected in the
   registry.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available, stable
   specification, e.g., as described in Section 7 of [RFC2026].

   Note that WebAuthn extensions can be registered by third parties
   (including the expert(s) themselves), if the expert(s) determine that
   an unregistered extension is widely deployed and not likely to be
   registered in a timely manner otherwise.  Such registrations still
   are subject to the requirements defined, including the need to
   reference a specification.

3.2.  Registration Request Processing

   As noted in Section 3.1, WebAuthn extension identifiers are
   registered using the Specification Required policy, implying review
   and approval by a designated expert.

   The expert(s) will clearly identify any issues which cause a
   registration to be refused.

   When a request is approved, the expert(s) will inform IANA, and the
   registration will be processed.  The IESG is the final arbiter of any
   objection.

3.3.  Initial WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry Values

   The initial values for the WebAuthn Extension Identifier Registry are
   to be populated from the values listed in "WebAuthn Extension
   Identifier Registrations" [10] of [WebAuthn].

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier and Extension
      Identifiers Registries

   This specification establishes two registries:

   o  the "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier" registry;
      see Section 2.
   o  the "WebAuthn Extension Identifier" registry; see Section 3.

   For both registries, the expert(s) and IANA will interact as outlined
   below:

   IANA will direct any incoming requests regarding either of these
   registries to this document and, if defined, the processes
   established by the expert(s); typically, this will mean referring
   them to the registry Web page.

   Note that the expert(s) are allowed (as per Section 2.1) to define
   additional fields to be collected in the registry.

5.  Security Considerations

   See [WebAuthn] for relevant security considerations.

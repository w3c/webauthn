# Introduction # {#intro}

[INFORMATIVE]

This specification defines an API enabling the creation and use of strong, attested, scoped, public key-based
credentials by web applications, for the purpose of strongly authenticating users. A [=public key credential=] is
created and stored by an <em>[=authenticator=]</em> at the behest of a <em>[=[RP]=]</em>, subject to <em>[=user
consent=]</em>. Subsequently, the [=public key credential=] can only be accessed by [=origins=] belonging to that [=[RP]=].
This scoping is enforced jointly by <em>[=conforming User Agents=]</em> and <em>[=authenticators=]</em>.
Additionally, privacy across [=[RPS]=] is maintained; [=[RPS]=] are not able to detect any properties, or even
the existence, of credentials scoped to other [RPS].

[=[RPS]=] employ the [=Web Authentication API=] during two distinct, but related, [=ceremonies=] involving a user. The first
is [=Registration=], where a [=public key credential=] is created on an [=authenticator=], and associated by a [=[RP]=]
with the present user's account (the account may already exist or may be created at this time). The second is
[=Authentication=], where the [=[RP]=] is presented with an <em>[=Authentication Assertion=]</em> proving the presence
and consent of the user who registered the [=public key credential=]. Functionally, the [=Web Authentication API=] comprises
a {{PublicKeyCredential}} which extends the Credential Management API [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]], and infrastructure which
allows those credentials to be used with {{CredentialsContainer/create()|navigator.credentials.create()}} and
{{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}}. The former is used during [=Registration=], and the
latter during [=Authentication=].

Broadly, compliant [=authenticators=] protect [=public key credentials=], and interact with user agents to implement the
[=Web Authentication API=]. Some authenticators may run on the same computing device (e.g., smart phone, tablet, desktop PC) as
the user agent is running on. For instance, such an authenticator might consist of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) applet,
a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or a Secure Element (SE) integrated into the computing device in conjunction with some means
for [=user verification=], along with appropriate platform software to mediate access to these components' functionality. Other
authenticators may operate autonomously from the computing device running the user agent, and be accessed over a transport such
as Universal Serial Bus (USB), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or Near Field Communications (NFC).


## Use Cases ## {#use-cases}

The below use case scenarios illustrate use of two very different types of [=authenticators=], as well as outline further
scenarios. Additional scenarios, including sample code, are given later in [[#sample-scenarios]].

### Registration ### {#usecase-registration}

- On a phone:
    * User navigates to example.com in a browser and signs in to an existing account using whatever method they have been using
        (possibly a legacy method such as a password), or creates a new account.
    * The phone prompts, "Do you want to register this device with example.com?"
    * User agrees.
    * The phone prompts the user for a previously configured [=authorization gesture=] (PIN, biometric, etc.); the user
        provides this.
    * Website shows message, "Registration complete."


### Authentication ### {#usecase-authentication}

- On a laptop or desktop:
    * User navigates to example.com in a browser, sees an option to "Sign in with your phone."
    * User chooses this option and gets a message from the browser, "Please complete this action on your phone."

- Next, on their phone:
    * User sees a discrete prompt or notification, "Sign in to example.com."
    * User selects this prompt / notification.
    * User is shown a list of their example.com identities, e.g., "Sign in as Alice / Sign in as Bob."
    * User picks an identity, is prompted for an [=authorization gesture=] (PIN, biometric, etc.) and provides this.

- Now, back on the laptop:
    * Web page shows that the selected user is signed-in, and navigates to the signed-in page.


### Other use cases and configurations ### {#other-configurations}

A variety of additional use cases and configurations are also possible, including (but not limited to):

- A user navigates to example.com on their laptop, is guided through a flow to create and register a credential on their phone.

- A user obtains an discrete, [=roaming authenticator=], such as a "fob" with USB or USB+NFC/BLE connectivity options, loads
    example.com in their browser on a laptop or phone, and is guided though a flow to create and register a credential on the
    fob.

- A [=[RP]=] prompts the user for their [=authorization gesture=] in order to authorize a single transaction, such as a payment
    or other financial transaction.

# Conformance # {#conformance}

This specification defines criteria for a [=Conforming User Agent=]: A User Agent MUST behave as described in this
specification in order to be considered conformant. [=Conforming User Agents=] MAY implement algorithms given in this
specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the
specification's algorithms. A conforming User Agent MUST also be a conforming implementation of the IDL fragments of this
specification, as described in the “Web IDL” specification. [[!WebIDL-1]]

This specification also defines a model of a conformant [=authenticator=] (see [[#authenticator-model]]). This is a set of
functional and security requirements for an authenticator to be usable by a [=Conforming User Agent=]. As described in
[[#use-cases]], an authenticator may be implemented in the operating system underlying the User Agent, or in external hardware,
or a combination of both.


## Dependencies ## {#dependencies}

This specification relies on several other underlying specifications, listed
below and in [[#index-defined-elsewhere]].

: Base64url encoding
:: The term <dfn>Base64url Encoding</dfn> refers to the base64 encoding using the URL- and filename-safe character set defined
    in Section 5 of [[!RFC4648]], with all trailing '=' characters omitted (as permitted by Section 3.2) and without the
    inclusion of any line breaks, whitespace, or other additional characters.

: CBOR
:: A number of structures in this specification, including attestation statements and extensions, are encoded using the Compact
    Binary Object Representation (<dfn>CBOR</dfn>) [[!RFC7049]].

: CDDL
:: This specification describes the syntax of all CBOR-encoded data using the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) [[!CDDL]].

:  Credential Management
:: The API described in this document is an extension of the {{Credential}} concept defined in [[!CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]].

: DOM
:: {{DOMException}} and the DOMException values used in this specification are defined in [[!DOM4]].

: ECMAScript
:: [=%ArrayBuffer%=] is defined in [[!ECMAScript]].

: HTML
:: The concepts of [=relevant settings object=], [=origin=],
    [=opaque origin=], and [=is a registrable domain suffix of or is equal to=] are defined in [[!HTML52]].

: Web Cryptography API
:: The {{AlgorithmIdentifier}} type and the method for [=normalizing an algorithm=] are defined in
    [[WebCryptoAPI#algorithm-dictionary]].

: Web IDL
:: Many of the interface definitions and all of the IDL in this specification depend on [[!WebIDL-1]]. This updated version of
    the Web IDL standard adds support for {{Promise}}s, which are now the preferred mechanism for asynchronous
    interaction in all new web APIs.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[!RFC2119]].


# Terminology # {#terminology}

: <dfn>Assertion</dfn>
:: See [=Authentication Assertion=].

: <dfn>Attestation</dfn>
:: Generally, <em>attestation</em> is a statement serving to bear witness, confirm, or authenticate.
    In the WebAuthn context, [=attestation=] is employed to <em>attest</em> to the <em>provenance</em> of an [=authenticator=]
    and the data it emits; including, for example: credential IDs, [=credential key pairs=], signature counters, etc. An
    [=attestation statement=] is conveyed in an [=attestation object=] during [=registration=]. See also [[#sctn-attestation]]
    and [Figure 3](#fig-attStructs).

: <dfn>Attestation Certificate</dfn>
:: A X.509 Certificate for the <dfn>attestation key pair</dfn> used by an [=authenticator=] to attest to its manufacture
    and capabilities. At [=registration=] time, the [=authenticator=] uses the <dfn>attestation private key</dfn> to sign
    the [=[RP]=]-specific [=credential public key=] (and additional data) that it generates and returns via the
    [=authenticatorMakeCredential=] operation. [=[RPS]=] use the <dfn>attestation public key</dfn> conveyed in the [=attestation
    certificate=] to verify the [=attestation signature=]. Note that in the case of [=self attestation=], the
    [=authenticator=] has no distinct [=attestation key pair=] nor [=attestation certificate=], see [=self
    attestation=] for details.

: <dfn>Authentication</dfn>
:: The [=ceremony=] where a user, and the user's computing device(s) (containing at least one [=authenticator=]) work in
    concert to cryptographically prove to an [=[RP]=] that the user controls the [=credential private key=] associated with a
    previously-registered [=public key credential=] (see [=Registration=]). Note that this typically includes employing a [=test
    of user presence=] or [=user verification=].

: <dfn>Authentication Assertion</dfn>
:: The cryptographically signed {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse}} object returned by an [=authenticator=] as the result of a
    [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] operation.

: <dfn>Authenticator</dfn>
:: A cryptographic device used by a [=[WAC]=] to (i) generate a [=public key credential=] and register it with a [=[RP]=],
    and (ii) subsequently used to cryptographically sign and return, in the form of an [=Authentication Assertion=], a
    challenge and other data presented by a [=[RP]=] (in concert with the [=[WAC]=]) in order to effect
    [=authentication=].

: <dfn>Authorization Gesture</dfn>
:: An [=authorization gesture=] is a physical interaction performed by a user with an authenticator as part of a [=ceremony=],
    such as [=registration=] or [=authentication=]. By making such an [=authorization gesture=], a user [=user consent|provides
    consent=] for (i.e., <em>authorizes</em>) a [=ceremony=] to proceed. This may involve [=user verification=] if the
    employed [=authenticator=] is capable, or it may involve a simple [=test of user presence=].

: <dfn>Biometric Recognition</dfn
:: The automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral characteristics [[ISOBiometricVocabulary]].

: <dfn>Ceremony</dfn>
:: The concept of a [=ceremony=] [[Ceremony]] is an extension of the concept of a network protocol, with human nodes alongside
    computer nodes and with communication links that include user interface(s), human-to-human communication, and transfers of
    physical objects that carry data. What is out-of-band to a protocol is in-band to a ceremony. In this specification,
    [=Registration=] and [=Authentication=] are ceremonies, and an [=authorization gesture=] is often a component of
    those [=ceremonies=].

: <dfn>Client</dfn>
:: See [=Conforming User Agent=].

: <dfn>Client-Side</dfn>
:: This refers in general to the combination of the user's platform device, user agent, authenticators, and everything gluing
    it all together.

: <dfn>Client-side-resident Credential Private Key</dfn>
:: A [=Client-side-resident Credential Private Key=] is stored either on the client platform, or in some cases on the
    authenticator itself, e.g., in the case of a discrete first-factor roaming authenticator. Such <dfn>client-side credential
    private key storage</dfn> has the property that the authenticator is able to select the [=credential private key=] given
    only an [=RP ID=], possibly with user assistance (e.g., by providing the user a pick list of credentials associated with the RP
    ID). By definition, the private key is always exclusively controlled by the Authenticator. In the case of a
    [=Client-side-resident Credential Private Key=], the Authenticator might offload storage of wrapped key material to the
    client platform, but the client platform is not expected to offload the key storage to remote entities (e.g. RP Server).

: <dfn>Conforming User Agent</dfn>
:: A user agent implementing, in conjunction with the underlying platform, the [=Web Authentication API=] and algorithms
    given in this specification, and handling communication between [=authenticators=] and [=[RPS]=].

: <dfn>Credential Public Key</dfn>
:: The public key portion of an [=[RP]=]-specific <dfn>credential key pair</dfn>, generated by an [=authenticator=] and
    returned to an [=[RP]=] at [=registration=] time (see also [=public key credential=]). The private key portion of the
    [=credential key pair=] is known as the <dfn>credential private key</dfn>. Note that in the case of [=self
    attestation=], the [=credential key pair=] is also used as the [=attestation key pair=], see [=self attestation=]
    for details.

: <dfn>Registration</dfn>
:: The [=ceremony=] where a user, a [=[RP]=], and the user's computing device(s) (containing at least one
    [=authenticator=]) work in concert to create a [=public key credential=] and associate it with the user's [=[RP]=] account.
    Note that this typically includes employing a [=test of user presence=] or [=user verification=].

: <dfn>[RP]</dfn>
:: The entity whose web application utilizes the [=Web Authentication API=] to register and authenticate users. See
    [=Registration=] and [=Authentication=], respectively.

        Note: While the term [=[RP]=] is used in other contexts (e.g., X.509 and OAuth), an entity acting as a [=[RP]=] in one
        context is not necessarily a [=[RP]=] in other contexts.

: <dfn>Relying Party Identifier</dfn>
: <dfn>RP ID</dfn>
:: A [=valid domain string=] that identifies the [=[RP]=] on whose behalf a given [=registration=] or
    [=authentication|authentication ceremony=] is being performed. A [=public key credential=] can only be used for
    [=authentication=] with the same entity (as identified by [=RP ID=]) it was registered with. By default, the [=RP ID=] for a
    WebAuthn operation is set to the caller's [=environment settings object/origin=]'s [=effective domain=]. This default MAY be
    overridden by the caller, as long as the caller-specified [=RP ID=] value [=is a registrable domain suffix of or is equal
    to=] the caller's [=environment settings object/origin=]'s [=effective domain=]. See also [[#createCredential]] and
    [[#getAssertion]].

    <div class="note" id="note-pkcredscope">
        Note: A [=Public key credential=]'s scope is for a [=[RP]=]'s [=origin=], with the following <em>restrictions</em> and
            <em>relaxations</em>:
            - The scheme is always `https` (i.e., <em>a restriction</em>), and,
            - the host may be equal to the [=[RP]=]'s [=origin=]'s [=effective domain=], or it may be equal to a registrable
                domain suffix of the [=[RP]=]'s [=origin=]'s [=effective domain=] (i.e., <em>an available relaxation</em>), and,
            - all (TCP) ports on that host (i.e., <em>a relaxation</em>).

        This is done in order to match the behavior of pervasively deployed ambient credentials (e.g., cookies, [[RFC6265]]).
        Please note that this is a greater relaxation of "same-origin" restrictions than what
        [=document.domain=]'s setter provides.
    </div>

: <dfn>Public Key Credential</dfn>
:: Generically, a <em>credential</em> is data one entity presents to another in order to <em>authenticate</em> the former to the
    latter [[RFC4949]]. A WebAuthn <em>[=public key credential=]</em> is a <code>{ identifier, type }</code> pair identifying
    authentication information established by the [=authenticator=] and the [=[RP]=], together, at [=registration=] time. The
    authentication information consists of an asymmetric key pair, where the [=credential public key|public key portion=] is
    returned to the [=[RP]=], who then stores it in conjunction with the present user's account. The [=authenticator=] maps the
    [=credential private key|private key portion=] to the [=[RP]=]'s [=RP ID=] and stores it. Subsequently, only that [=[RP]=],
    as identified by its [=RP ID=], is able to employ the [=public key credential=] in [=authentication|authentication
    ceremonies=], via the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} method. The [=[RP]=] uses its stored copy of the [=credential public
    key=] to verify the resultant [=authentication assertion=].

: <dfn>Test of User Presence</dfn>
: <dfn>TUP</dfn>
:: A [=test of user presence=] is a simple form of [=authorization gesture=] and technical process where a user interacts with
    an [=authenticator=] by (typically) simply touching it (other modalities may also exist), yielding a boolean result. Note
    that this does not constitute [=user verification=] because [=TUP=], by definition, is not capable of [=biometric
    recognition=], nor does it involve the presentation of a shared secret such as a password or PIN.

: <dfn>User Consent</dfn>
:: User consent means the user agrees with what they are being asked, i.e., it encompasses reading and understanding prompts.
    An [=authorization gesture=] is a [=ceremony=] component often employed to indicate [=user consent=].

: <dfn>User Verification</dfn>
:: The technical process by which an [=authenticator=] <em>locally authorizes</em> the invocation of the
    [=authenticatorMakeCredential=] and [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] operations. [=User verification=] may be instigated
    through various [=authorization gesture=] modalities; for example, through a touch plus pin code, password entry, or
    [=biometric recognition=] (e.g., presenting a fingerprint) [[ISOBiometricVocabulary]]. The intent is to be able to
    distinguish individual users. Note that invocation of the [=authenticatorMakeCredential=] and
    [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] operations implies use of key material managed by the authenticator. Note that for
    security, [=user verification=] and use of [=credential private keys=] must occur within a single logical security boundary
    defining the [=authenticator=].

: <dfn id=concept-user-verified>User Verified</dfn>
:: Upon successful completion of a [=user verification=] process, the user is said to be "verified".

: <dfn>[WAC]</dfn>
:: Also referred to herein as simply a [=client=]. See also [=Conforming User Agent=].


# <dfn>Web Authentication API</dfn> # {#api}

This section normatively specifies the API for creating and using [=public key credentials=]. The basic
idea is that the credentials belong to the user and are managed by an authenticator, with which the [=[RP]=] interacts through the
client (consisting of the browser and underlying OS platform). Scripts can (with the user's consent) request the browser to
create a new credential for future use by the [=[RP]=]. Scripts can also request the user’s permission to perform authentication
operations with an existing credential. All such operations are performed in the authenticator and are mediated by the browser
and/or platform on the user's behalf. At no point does the script get access to the credentials themselves; it only gets
information about the credentials in the form of objects.

In addition to the above script interface, the authenticator may implement (or come with client software that implements) a user
interface for management. Such an interface may be used, for example, to reset the authenticator to a clean state or to inspect
the current state of the authenticator. In other words, such an interface is similar to the user interfaces provided by browsers
for managing user state such as history, saved passwords and cookies. Authenticator management actions such as credential
deletion are considered to be the responsibility of such a user interface and are deliberately omitted from the API exposed to
scripts.

The security properties of this API are provided by the client and the authenticator working together. The authenticator, which
holds and manages credentials, ensures that all operations are scoped to a particular [=origin=], and cannot be replayed against
a different [=origin=], by incorporating the [=origin=] in its responses. Specifically, as defined in [[#authenticator-ops]],
the full [=origin=] of the requester is included, and signed over, in the [=attestation object=] produced when a new credential
is created as well as in all assertions produced by WebAuthn credentials.

Additionally, to maintain user privacy and prevent malicious [=[RPS]=] from probing for the presence of [=public key
credentials=] belonging to other [=[RPS]=], each [=public key credential|credential=] is also associated with a [=Relying Party
Identifier=], or [=RP ID=]. This [=RP ID=] is provided by the client to the [=authenticator=] for all operations, and the
[=authenticator=] ensures that [=public key credential|credentials=] created by a [=[RP]=] can only be used in operations
requested by the same [=RP ID=]. Separating the [=origin=] from the [=RP ID=] in this way allows the API to be used in cases
where a single [=[RP]=] maintains multiple [=origins=].

The client facilitates these security measures by providing the [=[RP]=]'s [=origin=] and [=RP ID=] to the [=authenticator=] for
each operation. Since this is an integral part of the WebAuthn security model, user agents only expose this API to callers in
[=secure contexts=].

The Web Authentication API is defined by the union of the Web IDL fragments presented in the following sections. A combined IDL
listing is given in the [[#idl-index]].

## <dfn interface>PublicKeyCredential</dfn> Interface ## {#iface-pkcredential}

The {{PublicKeyCredential}} interface inherits from {{Credential}} [[!CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]], and contains the attributes
that are returned to the caller when a new credential is created, or a new assertion is requested.

<xmp class="idl">

        [SameObject] readonly attribute AuthenticationExtensions clientExtensionResults;
    };
</xmp>
<dl dfn-type="attribute" dfn-for="PublicKeyCredential">
    :   {{Credential/id}}
    ::  This attribute is inherited from {{Credential}}, though {{PublicKeyCredential}} overrides {{Credential}}'s getter,
        instead returning the [=base64url encoding=] of the data contained in the object's
        {{PublicKeyCredential/[[identifier]]}} [=internal slot=].

    :   {{PublicKeyCredential/rawId}}
    ::  This attribute returns the {{ArrayBuffer}} contained in the {{PublicKeyCredential/[[identifier]]}} internal slot.

    :   <dfn>response</dfn>

        {{CredentialsContainer/create()}}, this attribute's value will be an {{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse}}, otherwise,
        the {{PublicKeyCredential}} was created in response to {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}, and this attribute's value
        will be an {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse}}.

        the format or length of this identifier, except that it must be sufficient for the platform to uniquely select a key.
        For example, an authenticator without on-board storage may create identifiers containing a [=credential private key=]
        wrapped with a symmetric key that is burned into the authenticator.

implementation of {{PublicKeyCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](options)}} and
{{PublicKeyCredential/[[Create]](options)}}.

### `CredentialCreationOptions` Extension ### {#credentialcreationoptions-extension}

To support registration via {{CredentialsContainer/create()|navigator.credentials.create()}}, this document extends
the {{CredentialCreationOptions}} dictionary as follows:

<pre class="idl">
    partial dictionary CredentialCreationOptions {
        MakeCredentialOptions      publicKey;

### `CredentialRequestOptions` Extension ### {#credentialrequestoptions-extension}

To support obtaining assertions via {{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}}, this document extends the
{{CredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary as follows:

### Create a new credential - PublicKeyCredential's `[[Create]](options)` method ### {#createCredential}

<div link-for-hint="PublicKeyCredential/[[Create]](options)">
{{PublicKeyCredential}}'s [=interface object=]'s implementation of the
<dfn for="PublicKeyCredential" method>\[[Create]](options)</dfn> method allows scripts to call
{{CredentialsContainer/create()|navigator.credentials.create()}} to request the creation of a new [=credential key pair=]
and {{PublicKeyCredential}}, managed by an [=authenticator=]. The user agent will prompt the user for [=user consent|consent=].
On success, the returned {{promise}} will be resolved with a {{PublicKeyCredential}} containing an
{{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse}} object.

Note: This algorithm is synchronous; the {{Promise}} resolution/rejection is handled by
{{CredentialsContainer/create()|navigator.credentials.create()}}.

This method accepts a single argument:

<dl dfn-type="argument" dfn-for="PublicKeyCredential/[[Create]](options)">
    :   <dfn>options</dfn>
    ::  This argument is a {{CredentialCreationOptions}} object whose
        <code>|options|.{{CredentialCreationOptions/publicKey}}</code> member contains a {{MakeCredentialOptions}} object
        specifying the desired attributes of the to-be-created [=public key credential=].
</dl>

When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST execute the following algorithm:

1. Assert: <code>|options|.{{CredentialCreationOptions/publicKey}}</code> is [=present=].

1. Let |options| be the value of <code>|options|.{{CredentialCreationOptions/publicKey}}</code>.

1. If any of the {{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/name}} member of |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/rp}}, the
    {{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/name}} member of |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/user}},
    the {{PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity/displayName}} member of |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/user}},
    or the {{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/id}}
    member of |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/user}} are [=present|not present=], return a {{TypeError}} [=simple exception=].

1. If the {{MakeCredentialOptions/timeout}} member of |options| is [=present=], check if its value lies within a
    reasonable range as defined by the platform and if not, correct it to the closest value lying within that range. Set
    |adjustedTimeout| to this adjusted value. If the {{MakeCredentialOptions/timeout}} member of |options| is [=present|not
    present=], then set |adjustedTimeout| to a platform-specific default.

1. Let |global| be the {{PublicKeyCredential}}'s [=interface object=]'s [=global object|environment settings object's global
    object=].

1. Let |callerOrigin| be the [=environment settings object/origin=] specified by this {{PublicKeyCredential}} [=interface
    object=]'s [=relevant settings object=]. If |callerOrigin| is an [=opaque origin=], return a {{DOMException}} whose name is
    "{{NotAllowedError}}", and terminate this algorithm.

1. Let |effectiveDomain| be the |callerOrigin|'s [=effective domain=]. If |effectiveDomain| is null,
    then return a {{DOMException}} whose name is "{{SecurityError}}" and terminate this algorithm.
<!-- PLACEHOLDER - https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/474

            and is not equal to=] |effectiveDomain|, return a {{DOMException}} whose name is "{{SecurityError}}", and terminate
            this algorithm.

        1. Set |rpId| to |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/rp}}.{{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/id}}.

            Note: |rpId| represents the caller's [=RP ID=]. The [=RP ID=] defaults to being the caller's [=environment settings
            object/origin=]'s [=effective domain=] unless the caller has explicitly set
            |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/rp}}.{{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/id}} when calling
            {{CredentialsContainer/create()}}.
    </li>

1. Let |normalizedParameters| be a new [=list=] whose [=list/items=] are pairs of {{PublicKeyCredentialType}} and a

    1. Let |normalizedAlgorithm| be the result of [=normalizing an algorithm=] [[!WebCryptoAPI]], with |alg| set to
        <code>|current|.{{PublicKeyCredentialParameters/alg}}</code> and |op| set to `"generateKey"`. If an error occurs during
        this procedure, then [=continue=].
    1. [=list/Append=] the pair of <code>|current|.{{PublicKeyCredentialParameters/type}}</code> and |normalizedAlgorithm| to
        |normalizedParameters|.

1. If |normalizedParameters| [=list/is empty=] and |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/parameters}} [=list/is not empty=],
    cancel the timer started in step 2, return a {{DOMException}} whose name is "{{NotSupportedError}}", and terminate this
    algorithm.

1. Let |clientExtensions| be a new [=map=] and let |authenticatorExtensions| be a new [=map=].

1. If the {{MakeCredentialOptions/extensions}} member of |options| is [=present=], then [=map/for each=]
    |extensionId| → |clientExtensionInput| of <code>|options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/extensions}}</code>:
    1. If |extensionId| is not supported by this client platform or is not a [=registration extension=], then [=continue=].

    1. [=map/Set=] |clientExtensions|[|extensionId|] to |clientExtensionInput|.

    1. If |extensionId| is not an [=authenticator extension=], then [=continue=].

    1. Let |authenticatorExtensionInput| be the ([=CBOR=]) result of running |extensionId|'s [=client extension processing=]

1. Let |clientDataJSON| be the [=JSON-serialized client data=] constructed from |collectedClientData|.

1. Let |clientDataHash| be the [=hash of the serialized client data=] represented by |clientDataJSON|.

1. Let |currentlyAvailableAuthenticators| be a new [=ordered set=] consisting of all [=authenticators=]
    available on this platform.

1. Let |selectedAuthenticators| be a new [=ordered set=].

1. If |currentlyAvailableAuthenticators| [=list/is empty=], return a {{DOMException}} whose name is
    "{{NotFoundError}}", and terminate this algorithm.

1. If |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/authenticatorSelection}} is [=present|present=], iterate through
        |currentlyAvailableAuthenticators| and do the following [=set/for each=] |authenticator|:

### Use an existing credential to make an assertion - PublicKeyCredential's `[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](options)` method ### {#getAssertion}

<div link-for-hint="PublicKeyCredential/[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](options)">
The <dfn for="PublicKeyCredential" method>\[[DiscoverFromExternalSource]](options)</dfn> method is used to discover and use an
existing [=public key credential=], with the user's consent. The script optionally specifies some criteria to indicate what
credentials are acceptable to it. The user agent and/or platform locates credentials matching the specified criteria, and guides
the user to pick one that the script will be allowed to use. The user may choose not to provide a credential even if one is
present, for example to maintain privacy.

Note: This algorithm is synchronous; the {{Promise}} resolution/rejection is handled by
{{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}}.

This method accepts a single argument:

## Authenticator Responses (interface <dfn interface>AuthenticatorResponse</dfn>) ## {#iface-authenticatorresponse}

[=Authenticators=] respond to [=[RP]=] requests by returning an object derived from the
{{AuthenticatorResponse}} interface:

<pre class="idl">
    [SecureContext]
    interface AuthenticatorResponse {
        [SameObject] readonly attribute ArrayBuffer      clientDataJSON;

</div>

### Information about Public Key Credential (interface <dfn interface>AuthenticatorAttestationResponse</dfn>) ### {#iface-authenticatorattestationresponse}

The {{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse}} interface represents the [=authenticator=]'s response to a client's request
for the creation of a new [=public key credential=]. It contains information about the new credential that can be used to
identify it for later use, and metadata that can be used by the [=[RP]=] to assess the characteristics of the credential
during registration.

<pre class="idl">

        over it.

    :   <dfn>attestationObject</dfn>
    ::  This attribute contains an [=attestation object=], which is opaque to, and cryptographically protected against
        tampering by, the client. The [=attestation object=] contains both [=authenticator data=] and an [=attestation
        statement=]. The former contains the AAGUID, a unique credential ID, and the [=credential public key=]. The
        contents of the [=attestation statement=] are determined by the [=attestation statement format=] used by the
        [=authenticator=]. It also contains any additional information that the [=[RP]=]'s server requires to validate the
        [=attestation statement=], as well as to decode and validate the [=authenticator data=] along with the
        [=JSON-serialized client data=]. For more details, see [[#sctn-attestation]], [[#generating-an-attestation-object]],
        and [Figure 3](#fig-attStructs).
</div>

### Web Authentication Assertion (interface <dfn interface>AuthenticatorAssertionResponse</dfn>) ### {#iface-authenticatorassertionresponse}

The {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse}} interface represents an [=authenticator=]'s response to a client's request for
generation of a new [=authentication assertion=] given the [=[RP]=]'s challenge and optional list of credentials it is
aware of. This response contains a cryptographic signature proving possession of the [=credential private key=], and
optionally evidence of [=user consent=] to a specific transaction.

<pre class="idl">

        over it.

    :   <dfn>authenticatorData</dfn>

        Its value's {{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/id}} member is required, and contains an identifier for the account, specified
        by the [=[RP]=]. This is not meant to be displayed to the user, but is used by the [=[RP]=] to control the

### Public Key Entity Description (dictionary <dfn dictionary>PublicKeyCredentialEntity</dfn>) ### {#dictionary-pkcredentialentity}

The {{PublicKeyCredentialEntity}} dictionary describes a user account, or a [=[RP]=], with which a [=public key credential=] is
associated.

<xmp class="idl">
    dictionary PublicKeyCredentialEntity {

        entity, this will be an arbitrary string specified by the [=relying party=].

    :   <dfn>name</dfn>
    ::  A human-friendly identifier for the entity. For example, this could be a company name for a [=[RP]=], or a
        user's name. This identifier is intended for display.

    :   <dfn>icon</dfn>
    ::  A [=URL serializer|serialized=] URL which resolves to an image associated with the entity. For example, this could be
        a user's avatar or a [=[RP]=]'s logo.
</div>


### User Account Parameters for Credential Generation (dictionary <dfn dictionary>PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity</dfn>) ### {#sctn-user-credential-params}

The {{PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity}} dictionary is used to supply additional user account attributes when creating a new
credential.

<pre class="idl">
    dictionary PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity : PublicKeyCredentialEntity {
        DOMString      displayName;
    };

<div dfn-type="dict-member" dfn-for="PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity">
    :   <dfn>displayName</dfn>
    ::  A friendly name for the user account (e.g., "John P. Smith").
</div>


### Authenticator Selection Criteria (dictionary <dfn dictionary>AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria</dfn>) ### {#authenticatorSelection}

[=[RPS]=] may use the {{AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria}} dictionary to specify their requirements regarding authenticator
attributes.

<xmp class="idl">
    dictionary AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria {
        AuthenticatorAttachment      attachment;
        boolean                      requireResidentKey = false;
    };
</xmp>

<div dfn-type="dict-member" dfn-for="AuthenticatorSelectionCriteria">
    :   <dfn>attachment</dfn>
    ::  If this member is [=present|present=], eligible authenticators are filtered to only authenticators attached with the
        specified [[#attachment]].

    :   <dfn>requireResidentKey</dfn>
    ::  This member describes the [=[RPS]=]' requirements regarding availability of the [=Client-side-resident Credential
        Private Key=]. If the parameter is set to true, the authenticator MUST create a
        [=Client-side-resident Credential Private Key=] when creating a [=public key credential=].
</div>


### Authenticator Attachment enumeration (enum <dfn enum>AuthenticatorAttachment</dfn>) ### {#attachment}

<pre class="idl">
    enum AuthenticatorAttachment {
        "platform",
        "cross-platform"
    };
</pre>

Clients may communicate with authenticators using a variety of mechanisms. For example, a client may use a platform-specific
API to communicate with an authenticator which is physically bound to a platform. On the other hand, a client may use a
variety of standardized cross-platform transport protocols such as Bluetooth (see [[#transport]]) to discover and
communicate with [=cross-platform attached=] authenticators. Therefore, we use {{AuthenticatorAttachment}} to describe an
[=authenticator=]'s <dfn>attachment modality</dfn>. We define authenticators that are part of the client's
platform as having a [=platform attachment=], and refer to them as <dfn>platform authenticators</dfn>. While those that
are reachable via cross-platform transport protocols are defined as having [=cross-platform attachment=], and refer to
them as <dfn>roaming authenticators</dfn>.

<ul>
    <li><dfn>platform attachment</dfn> - the respective authenticator is attached
        using platform-specific transports.  Usually, authenticators of
        this class are non-removable from the platform.
    <li><dfn lt="cross-platform attached|cross-platform attachment">cross-platform attachment</dfn> - the respective
        authenticator is attached using cross-platform transports. Authenticators of this class are removable from, and can
        "roam" among, client platforms.
</ul>

This distinction is important because there are use-cases where only [=platform authenticators=] are acceptable to a
[=[RP]=], and conversely ones where only [=roaming authenticators=] are employed. As a concrete example of the former, a
credential on a [=platform authenticator=] may be used by [=[RPS]=] to quickly and conveniently reauthenticate the user with
a minimum of friction, e.g., the user will not have to dig around in their pocket for their key fob or phone. As a concrete
example of the latter, when the user is accessing the [=[RP]=] from a given client for the first time, they may be required to
use a [=roaming authenticator=] which was originally registered with the [=[RP]=] using a different client.


## Options for Assertion Generation (dictionary <dfn dictionary>PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions</dfn>) ## {#assertion-options}

The {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions}} dictionary supplies {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} with the data it needs to generate
an assertion. Its {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/challenge}} member must be present, while its other members are optional.

        The value is treated as a hint, and may be overridden by the platform.

    :   <dfn>rpId</dfn>
    ::  This optional member specifies the [=relying party identifier=] claimed by the caller. If omitted, its value will

    :   <dfn>allowCredentials</dfn>
    ::  This optional member contains a list of {{PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor}} object representing [=public key credentials=]
        acceptable to the caller, in decending order of the caller's preference (the first item in the list is the most
        preferred credential, and so on down the list).

    :   <dfn>extensions</dfn>
    ::  This optional member contains additional parameters requesting additional processing by the client and authenticator.
        For example, if transaction confirmation is sought from the user, then the prompt string might be included as an

## Authentication Extensions (typedef <dfn>AuthenticationExtensions</dfn>) ## {#iface-authentication-extensions}

<pre class="idl">

This is a dictionary containing zero or more WebAuthn extensions, as defined in [[#extensions]].
An AuthenticationExtensions instance can contain either [=client extensions=] or [=authenticator extensions=], depending upon
context.


## Supporting Data Structures ## {#supporting-data-structures}

The [=public key credential=] type uses certain data structures that are specified in supporting specifications. These are as
follows.


### Client data used in WebAuthn signatures (dictionary <dfn dictionary>CollectedClientData</dfn>) ### {#sec-client-data}

The <dfn>client data</dfn> represents the contextual bindings of both the [=[RP]=] and the client platform. It is a key-value
mapping with string-valued keys. Values may be any type that has a valid encoding in JSON. Its structure is defined by the
following Web IDL.

<pre class="idl">
    dictionary CollectedClientData {
        required DOMString           challenge;
        required DOMString           origin;

        DOMString                    tokenBindingId;
        AuthenticationExtensions     clientExtensions;
        AuthenticationExtensions     authenticatorExtensions;
    };
</pre>

<div dfn-type="dict-member" dfn-for="CollectedClientData">
    The <dfn>challenge</dfn> member contains the base64url encoding of the challenge provided by the RP.

    The <dfn>origin</dfn> member contains the fully qualified [=origin=] of the requester, as provided to the authenticator by
    the client, in the syntax defined by [[RFC6454]].

    The <dfn>hashAlgorithm</dfn> member is a [=recognized algorithm name=] that supports the `"digest"` operation, which
    specifies the algorithm used to compute the [=hash of the serialized client data=]. This algorithm is chosen by the client
    at its sole discretion.

    The <dfn>tokenBindingId</dfn> member contains the base64url encoding of the [=Token Binding ID=] that this client uses for
    the [=Token Binding=] protocol when communicating with the [=[RP]=]. This can be omitted if no [=Token Binding=] has been
    negotiated between the client and the [=[RP]=].

    The optional <dfn>clientExtensions</dfn> and <dfn>authenticatorExtensions</dfn> members contain additional parameters
    generated by processing the extensions passed in
    by the [=[RP]=]. WebAuthn extensions are detailed in Section [[#extensions]].

    This structure is used by the client to compute the following quantities:

    : <dfn dfn>JSON-serialized client data</dfn>
    :: This is the [=UTF-8 encoding=] of the result of calling the initial value of {{JSON/stringify|JSON.stringify}} on a
        {{CollectedClientData}} dictionary.

    : <dfn dfn>Hash of the serialized client data</dfn>
    :: This is the hash (computed using {{hashAlgorithm}}) of the [=JSON-serialized client data=], as constructed by the client.

### Credential Type enumeration (enum <dfn enum>PublicKeyCredentialType</dfn>) ### {#credentialType}

<pre class="idl">
    enum PublicKeyCredentialType {
        "public-key",
        "public-key-uaf"
    };
</pre>

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="PublicKeyCredentialType">
    This enumeration defines the valid credential types. It is an extension point; values may be added to it in the future, as
    more credential types are defined. The values of this enumeration are used for versioning the Authentication Assertion and
    attestation structures according to the type of the authenticator.

    Currently two credential types are defined, namely "<dfn>public-key</dfn>" and "<dfn>public-key-uaf</dfn>".
</div>


### Credential Descriptor (dictionary <dfn dictionary>PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor</dfn>) ### {#credential-dictionary}

<xmp class="idl">
    dictionary PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor {

        required BufferSource                 id;
        sequence<AuthenticatorTransport>      transports;
    };
</xmp>

This dictionary contains the attributes that are specified by a caller when referring to a credential as an input parameter to
the {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} or {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} methods. It mirrors the fields of the
{{PublicKeyCredential}} object returned by the latter methods.

<div dfn-type="dict-member" dfn-for="PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor">
    The <dfn>type</dfn> member contains the type of the credential the caller is referring to.

        "ble"
    };
</pre>

<div dfn-type="enum-value" dfn-for="AuthenticatorTransport">
    Authenticators may communicate with Clients using a variety of transports. This enumeration defines a hint as to how Clients
    might communicate with a particular Authenticator in order to obtain an assertion for a specific credential. Note that these
    hints represent the [=[RP]=]'s best belief as to how an Authenticator may be reached. A [=[RP]=] may obtain a list of
    transports hints from some [=attestation statement formats=] or via some out-of-band mechanism; it is outside the scope of
    this specification to define that mechanism.

    <ul>
        <li><dfn>usb</dfn> - the respective Authenticator may be contacted over USB.
        <li><dfn>nfc</dfn> - the respective Authenticator may be contacted over Near Field Communication (NFC).
        <li><dfn>ble</dfn> - the respective Authenticator may be contacted over Bluetooth Smart (Bluetooth Low Energy / BLE).
    </ul>
</div>


### Cryptographic Algorithm Identifier (type {{AlgorithmIdentifier}}) ### {#alg-identifier}

A string or dictionary identifying a cryptographic algorithm and optionally a set of parameters for that algorithm. This type is
defined in [[!WebCryptoAPI]].


# WebAuthn Authenticator model # {#authenticator-model}

The API defined in this specification implies a specific abstract functional model for an [=authenticator=]. This section
describes the authenticator model.

Client platforms may implement and expose this abstract model in any way desired. However, the behavior of the client's Web
Authentication API implementation, when operating on the authenticators supported by that platform, MUST be indistinguishable
from the behavior specified in [[#api]].

For authenticators, this model defines the logical operations that they must support, and the data formats that they expose to
the client and the [=[RP]=]. However, it does not define the details of how authenticators communicate with the client platform,
unless they are required for interoperability with [RPS]. For instance, this abstract model does not define protocols for
connecting authenticators to clients over transports such as USB or NFC. Similarly, this abstract model does not define specific
error codes or methods of returning them; however, it does define error behavior in terms of the needs of the client. Therefore,
specific error codes are mentioned as a means of showing which error conditions must be distinguishable (or not) from each other
in order to enable a compliant and secure client implementation.

In this abstract model, the authenticator provides key management and cryptographic signatures. It may be embedded in the
WebAuthn client, or housed in a separate device entirely. The authenticator may itself contain a cryptographic module which
operates at a higher security level than the rest of the authenticator. This is particularly important for authenticators that
are embedded in the WebAuthn client, as in those cases this cryptographic module (which may, for example, be a TPM) could be
considered more trustworthy than the rest of the authenticator.

Each authenticator stores some number of [=public key credentials=]. Each [=public key credential=] has an identifier which is
unique (or extremely unlikely to be duplicated) among all [=public key credentials=]. Each credential is also associated with a
[=[RP]=], whose identity is represented by a [=Relying Party Identifier=] ([=RP ID=]).

Each authenticator has an AAGUID, which is a 128-bit identifier that indicates the type (e.g. make and model) of the
authenticator. The AAGUID MUST be chosen by the manufacturer to be identical across all substantially identical authenticators
made by that manufacturer, and different (with probability 1-2<sup>-128</sup> or greater) from the AAGUIDs of all other types of
authenticators. The RP MAY use the AAGUID to infer certain properties of the authenticator, such as certification level and
strength of key protection, using information from other sources.

The primary function of the authenticator is to provide WebAuthn signatures, which are bound to various contextual data. These
data are observed, and added at different levels of the stack as a signature request passes from the server to the
authenticator. In verifying a signature, the server checks these bindings against expected values. These contextual bindings
are divided in two: Those added by the RP or the client, referred to as [=client data=]; and those added by the authenticator,
referred to as the [=authenticator data=]. The authenticator signs over the [=client data=], but is otherwise not interested in
its contents. To save bandwidth and processing requirements on the authenticator, the client hashes the [=client data=] and
sends only the result to the authenticator. The authenticator signs over the combination of the
[=hash of the serialized client data=], and its own [=authenticator data=].

The goals of this design can be summarized as follows.

- The scheme for generating signatures should accommodate cases where the link between the client platform and authenticator
    is very limited, in bandwidth and/or latency. Examples include Bluetooth Low Energy and Near-Field Communication.

- The data processed by the authenticator should be small and easy to interpret in low-level code. In particular, authenticators
    should not have to parse high-level encodings such as JSON.

- Both the client platform and the authenticator should have the flexibility to add contextual bindings as needed.

- The design aims to reuse as much as possible of existing encoding formats in order to aid adoption and implementation.

Authenticators produce cryptographic signatures for two distinct purposes:
1. An <dfn>attestation signature</dfn> is produced when a new [=public key credential=] is created via an
    [=authenticatorMakeCredential=] operation. An [=attestation signature=] provides cryptographic
    proof of certain properties of the the [=authenticator=] and the credential. For instance, an [=attestation signature=]
    asserts the [=authenticator=] type (as denoted by its AAGUID) and the [=credential public key=]. The [=attestation
    signature=] is signed by an [=attestation private key=], which is chosen depending on the type of [=attestation=] desired.
    For more details on [=attestation=], see [[#sctn-attestation]].
2. An <dfn>assertion signature</dfn> is produced when the [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] method is invoked. It represents an
    assertion by the [=authenticator=] that the user has [=user consent|consented=] to a specific transaction, such as logging
    in, or completing a purchase. Thus, an [=assertion signature=] asserts that the [=authenticator=] possessing a particular
    [=credential private key=] has established, to the best of its ability, that the user requesting this transaction is the
    same user who [=user consent|consented=] to creating that particular [=public key credential=]. It also asserts additional
    information, termed [=client data=], that may be useful to the caller, such as the means by which [=user consent=] was
    provided, and the prompt shown to the user by the [=authenticator=]. The [=assertion signature=] format is illustrated in
    [Figure 2, below](#fig-signature).

The formats of these signatures, as well as the procedures for generating them, are specified below.


## Authenticator data ## {#sec-authenticator-data}

The <dfn>authenticator data</dfn> structure encodes contextual bindings made by the [=authenticator=]. These bindings are
controlled by the authenticator itself, and derive their trust from the [=[RP]=]'s assessment of the security properties of the
authenticator. In one extreme case, the authenticator may be embedded in the client, and its bindings may be no more trustworthy
than the [=client data=]. At the other extreme, the authenticator may be a discrete entity with high-security hardware and
software, connected to the client over a secure channel. In both cases, the [=[RP]=] receives the [=authenticator data=] in the same
format, and uses its knowledge of the authenticator to make trust decisions.

The [=authenticator data=] has a compact but extensible encoding. This is desired since authenticators can be devices with
limited capabilities and low power requirements, with much simpler software stacks than the client platform components.

The [=authenticator data=] structure is a byte array of 37 bytes or more, as follows.

<table class="complex data longlastcol">
    <tr>
        <th>Length (in bytes)</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>32</td>
        <td>
            SHA-256 hash of the [=RP ID=] associated with the credential.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>
            Flags (bit 0 is the least significant bit):
            - Bit 0: [=Test of User Presence=] (`TUP`) result.
            - Bits 1-5: Reserved for future use (`RFU`).
            - Bit 6: [=Attestation data=] included (`AT`). Indicates whether the authenticator added [=attestation data=].
            - Bit 7: Extension data included (`ED`). Indicates if the [=authenticator data=] has extensions.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>Signature counter (`signCount`), 32-bit unsigned big-endian integer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>variable (if present)</td>
        <td>
            [=attestation data=] (if present). See [[#sec-attestation-data]] for details. Its length depends on the length of
            the [=credential public key=] and credential ID being attested.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>variable (if present)</td>
        <td>
            Extension-defined [=authenticator data=]. This is a [=CBOR=] [[RFC7049]] map with [=extension identifiers=] as keys,
            and [=authenticator extension outputs=] as values. See [[#extensions]] for details.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The [=RP ID=] is originally received from the client when the credential is created, and again when an assertion is generated.
However, it differs from other [=client data=] in some important ways. First, unlike the client data, the [=RP ID=] of a
credential does not change between operations but instead remains the same for the lifetime of that credential. Secondly, it is
validated by the authenticator during the [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] operation, by verifying that the [=RP ID=] associated
with the requested credential exactly matches the [=RP ID=] supplied by the client, and that the [=RP ID=] [=is a registrable
domain suffix of or is equal to=] the [=effective domain=] of the RP's [=origin=]'s [=effective domain=].

The `TUP` flag SHALL be set if and only if the authenticator detected a user through an authenticator specific gesture. The
`RFU` bits SHALL be set to zero.

For attestation signatures, the authenticator MUST set the AT flag and include the [=attestation data=]. For authentication
signatures, the AT flag MUST NOT be set and the [=attestation data=] MUST NOT be included.

If the authenticator does not include any extension data, it MUST set the `ED` flag to zero, and to one if
extension data is included.

The [figure below](#fig-authData) shows a visual representation of the [=authenticator data=] structure.

<figure id="fig-authData">
    <img src="images/fido-signature-formats-figure1.svg"/>
    <figcaption>[=Authenticator data=] layout.</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that the [=authenticator data=] describes its own length: If the AT and ED flags are not set, it is always 37 bytes long.
The [=attestation data=] (which is only present if the AT flag is set) describes its own length. If the ED flag is set, then the
total length is 37 bytes plus the length of the [=attestation data=], plus the length of the [=CBOR=] map that follows.


## Authenticator operations ## {#authenticator-ops}

A client must connect to an authenticator in order to invoke any of the operations of that authenticator. This connection
defines an authenticator session. An authenticator must maintain isolation between sessions. It may do this by only allowing one
session to exist at any particular time, or by providing more complicated session management.

The following operations can be invoked by the client in an authenticator session.


### The <dfn>authenticatorMakeCredential</dfn> operation ### {#op-make-cred}

This operation must be invoked in an authenticator session which has no other operations in progress. It takes the following
input parameters:

- The caller's [=RP ID=], as <a href='#CreateCred-DetermineRpId'>determined</a> by the user agent and the client.
- The [=hash of the serialized client data=], provided by the client.
- The [=[RP]=]'s {{PublicKeyCredentialEntity}}.
- The user account's {{PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity}}.
- A sequence of pairs of {{PublicKeyCredentialType}} and cryptographic algorithms (a dictionary type) requested by the [=[RP]=],
    where the cryptographic algorithms are normalized as per the procedure in
    [[WebCryptoAPI#algorithm-normalization-normalize-an-algorithm]]. This sequence is is ordered from most preferred to least
    preferred. The platform makes a best-effort to create the most preferred credential that it can.
- An optional list of {{PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor}} objects provided by the [=[RP]=] with the intention that, if any of
    these are known to the authenticator, it should not create a new credential.
- Extension data created by the client based on the extensions requested by the [=[RP]=], if any.
- The |requireResidentKey| parameter of the |options|.{{MakeCredentialOptions/authenticatorSelection}} dictionary.

When this operation is invoked, the authenticator must perform the following procedure:
- Check if all the supplied parameters are syntactically well-formed and of the correct length. If not, return an error code
    equivalent to "{{UnknownError}}" and terminate the operation.
-  Check if at least one of the specified combinations of {{PublicKeyCredentialType}} and cryptographic parameters is supported.
    If not, return an error code equivalent to "{{NotSupportedError}}" and terminate the operation.
- Check if a credential matching any of the supplied {{PublicKeyCredential}} identifiers is present on this authenticator. If
    so, return an error code equivalent to "{{NotAllowedError}}" and terminate the operation.
- If the |requireResidentKey| flag is set to |true| and the authenticator cannot store a [=Client-side-resident Credential
    Private Key=], return an error code equivalent to "{{ConstraintError}}" and terminate the operation.
- The [=authenticator=] must perform the following procedure depending on the PublicKeyCredentialType of the preferred combination of {{PublicKeyCredentialType}} and cryptographic parameters supported by this authenticator:
    <dl class="switch">
    <dt>"public-key"</dt>
    <dd>
    - Prompt the user for consent to create a new credential. The prompt for obtaining this consent is shown by the authenticator
        if it has its own output capability, or by the user agent otherwise. If the user denies consent, return an error code
        equivalent to "{{NotAllowedError}}" and terminate the operation.
    - Once user consent has been obtained, generate a new credential object:
        - Generate a set of cryptographic keys using the most preferred combination of {{PublicKeyCredentialType}} and cryptographic
            parameters supported by this authenticator.
        - Generate an identifier for this credential, such that this identifier is globally unique with high probability across all
            credentials with the same type across all authenticators.
        - Associate the credential with the specified [=RP ID=] and the user's account identifier
            {{MakeCredentialOptions/user}}.{{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/id}}.
        - Delete any older credentials with the same [=RP ID=] and {{MakeCredentialOptions/user}}.{{PublicKeyCredentialEntity/id}}
            that are stored locally by the [=authenticator=].
    - If any error occurred while creating the new credential object, return an error code equivalent to "{{UnknownError}}" and
        terminate the operation.
    - Process all the supported extensions requested by the client, and generate the [=authenticator data=] with
        [=attestation data=] as specified in [[#sec-authenticator-data]]. Use this [=authenticator data=] and the
        [=hash of the serialized client data=] to create an [=attestation object=] for the new credential using the procedure
        specified in [[#generating-an-attestation-object]]. For more details on attestation, see [[#sctn-attestation]].

    - On successful completion of this operation, the authenticator returns the [=attestation object=] to the client.

    </dd>
    <dt>"public-key-uaf"</dt>
    <dd>

    - Follow the procedure as specified in [[FIDO-UAF-Authenticator-Commands]] section 6.2. Using
        * The caller's RP ID as "AppID"
        * The [=hash of the serialized client data=] as "Final Challenge Hash".
        * The {{MakeCredentialOptions/user}}.{{PublicKeyCredentialUserEntity/displayName}} as "Username".
        * Provide TAG_ATTESTATION_BASIC_FULL (0x3E07) as "Attestation Type".
        * Provide a "KHAccessToken" as described in section 6.1. in [[FIDO-UAF-ASM]].
        * Provide no "UserVerificationToken".
    - On successful completion of this operation, the authenticator returns the registration assertion as [=attestation object=] to the client.

    </dd>
    </dl>
    

### The <dfn>authenticatorGetAssertion</dfn> operation ### {#op-get-assertion}

This operation must be invoked in an authenticator session which has no other operations in progress. It takes the following
input parameters:

- The caller's [=RP ID=], as <a href='#GetAssn-DetermineRpId'>determined</a> by the user agent and the client.
- The [=hash of the serialized client data=], provided by the client.
- A list of credentials acceptable to the [=[RP]=] (possibly filtered by the client), if any.
- Extension data created by the client based on the extensions requested by the [=[RP]=], if any.

The [=authenticator=] must perform the following procedure (independent 
of the PublicKeyCredentialType of any related [=credential=]):
- Check if all the supplied parameters are syntactically well-formed and of the correct length. If not, return an error code
    equivalent to "{{UnknownError}}" and terminate the operation.
- If a list of credentials was supplied by the client, filter it by removing those credentials that are not present on this
    [=authenticator=]. If no list was supplied, create a list with all credentials stored for the caller's [=RP ID=] (as
    determined by an exact match of the [=RP ID=]).
- If the previous step resulted in an empty list, return an error code equivalent to "{{NotAllowedError}}" and terminate the
    operation.
- Prompt the user to select a [=public key credential|credential=] from among the above list. 

- The [=authenticator=] must perform the following procedure depending on the PublicKeyCredentialType of the [=credential=]:
    <dl class="switch">
    <dt>"public-key"</dt>
    <dd>
    - Obtain [=user consent=] for using
        this [=public key credential|credential=]. The prompt for obtaining this [=user consent|consent=] may be shown by the
        [=authenticator=] if it has its own output capability, or by the user agent otherwise.
    - Process all the supported extensions requested by the client, and generate the [=authenticator data=] as specified in 
        [[#sec-authenticator-data]], though without [=attestation data=]. Concatenate this [=authenticator data=] with the [=hash of
        the serialized client data=] to generate an [=assertion signature=] using the [=credential private key|private key=] of the
        selected [=public key credential|credential=] as shown in [Figure 2](#fig-signature), below. A simple, undelimited
        concatenation is safe to use here because the [=authenticator data=] describes its own length. The [=hash of the serialized
        client data=] (which potentially has a variable length) is always the last element.
    - If any error occurred while generating the [=assertion signature=], return an error code equivalent to "{{UnknownError}}" and
        terminate the operation.
        <figure id="fig-signature">
            <img src="images/fido-signature-formats-figure2.svg"/>
            <figcaption>Generating an [=assertion signature=].</figcaption>
        </figure>

    - On successful completion, the [=authenticator=] returns to the user agent:
        - The identifier of the credential (credential ID) used to generate the [=assertion signature=].
        - The [=authenticator data=] used to generate the [=assertion signature=].
        - The [=assertion signature=].

    If the [=authenticator=] cannot find any credential corresponding to the specified [=[RP]=] that matches the specified criteria, it
    terminates the operation and returns an error.

    If the user refuses consent, the authenticator returns an appropriate error status to the client.
    </dd>
    <dt>"public-key-uaf"</dt>
    <dd>
    - Follow the procedure as specified in [[FIDO-UAF-Authenticator-Commands]] section 6.3. Using
        * The caller's RP ID as "AppID"
        * The [=hash of the serialized client data=] as "Final Challenge Hash".
        * If present: The content of extension txAuthSimple (i.e. the string) or txAuthGeneric (i.e. the content bytes) as "Transaction Content".
        * If a list of credentials acceptable to the [=[RP]=] was provided: Provide each {{PublicKeyCredential/rawId}} as "KeyHandle".  If an empty list was provided do not provide any "KeyHandle".
        * Provide a "KHAccessToken" as described in section 6.1. in [[FIDO-UAF-ASM]].
        * Provide no "UserVerificationToken".
    - On successful completion, the [=authenticator=] returns to the user agent:
        * The identifier of the credential used to generate the signature.
        * binary authenticator generated data according to the structure as specified in [[FIDO-UAF-Authenticator-Commands]] section 5.2.2.
        * The assertion signature.

    If the [=authenticator=] cannot find any credential corresponding to the specified [RP] that matches the specified criteria, it
    terminates the operation and returns an error.
    
    If the user refuses consent, the [=authenticator=] returns an appropriate error status to the client.
    </dd>
    </dl>

### The <dfn>authenticatorCancel</dfn> operation ### {#op-cancel}

This operation takes no input parameters and returns no result.

When this operation is invoked by the client in an authenticator session, it has the effect of terminating any
[=authenticatorMakeCredential=] or [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] operation currently in progress in that authenticator
session. The authenticator stops prompting for, or accepting, any user input related to authorizing the canceled operation. The
client ignores any further responses from the authenticator for the canceled operation.

This operation is ignored if it is invoked in an authenticator session which does not have an [=authenticatorMakeCredential=]
or [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] operation currently in progress.


## Attestation ## {#sctn-attestation}

[=Authenticators=] must also provide some form of [=attestation=]. The basic requirement is that the [=authenticator=] can
produce, for each [=credential public key=], an [=attestation statement=] verifable by the [=[RP]=]. Typically, this
[=attestation statement=] contains a signature by an [=attestation private key=] over the attested [=credential public key=] and
a challenge, as well as a certificate or similar data providing provenance information for the [=attestation public key=],
enabling the [=[RP]=] to make a trust decision. However, if an [=attestation key pair=] is not available, then the authenticator
MUST perform [=self attestation=] of the [=credential public key=] with the corresponding [=credential private key=]. All this
information is returned by [=authenticators=] any time a new [=public key credential=] is generated, in the overall form of an
<dfn>attestation object</dfn>. The relationship of the [=attestation object=] with [=authenticator data=] (containing
[=attestation data=]) and the [=attestation statement=] is illustrated in [figure 3](#fig-attStructs), below.

<figure id="fig-attStructs">
    <img src="images/fido-attestation-structures.svg"/>
    <figcaption>[=Attestation object=] layout illustrating the included [=authenticator data=] (containing [=attestation data=])
    and the [=attestation statement=].</figcaption>
    <div class="note">
        This figure illustrates only the `packed` [=attestation statement format=]. Several additional [=attestation statement
        formats=] are defined in [[#defined-attestation-formats]].
    </div>
</figure>

An important component of the [=attestation object=] is the <dfn>attestation statement</dfn>. This is a specific type of signed
data object, containing statements about a [=public key credential=] itself and the [=authenticator=] that created it. It
contains an [=attestation signature=] created using the key of the attesting authority (except for the case of [=self
attestation=], when it is created using the [=credential private key=]). In order to correctly interpret an [=attestation
statement=], a [=[RP]=] needs to understand these two aspects of [=attestation=]:

1. The <dfn>attestation statement format</dfn> is the manner in which the signature is represented and the various contextual
    bindings are incorporated into the attestation statement by the [=authenticator=]. In other words, this defines the
    syntax of the statement. Various existing devices and platforms (such as TPMs and the Android OS) have previously defined
    [=attestation statement formats=]. This specification supports a variety of such formats in an extensible way, as defined in
    [[#attestation-formats]].

2. The <dfn>attestation type</dfn> defines the semantics of [=attestation statements=] and their underlying trust models.
    Specifically, it defines how a [=[RP]=] establishes trust in a particular [=attestation statement=], after verifying that it
    is cryptographically valid. This specification supports a number of [=attestation types=], as described in
    [[#sctn-attestation-types]].

In general, there is no simple mapping between [=attestation statement formats=] and [=attestation types=]. For example, the
"packed" [=attestation statement format=] defined in [[#packed-attestation]] can be used in conjunction with all [=attestation
types=], while other formats and types have more limited applicability.

The privacy, security and operational characteristics of [=attestation=] depend on:
- The [=attestation type=], which determines the trust model,
- The [=attestation statement format=], which may constrain the strength of the [=attestation=] by limiting what can be
    expressed in an [=attestation statement=], and
- The characteristics of the individual [=authenticator=], such as its construction, whether part or all of it runs in a secure
    operating environment, and so on.

It is expected that most [=authenticators=] will support a small number of [=attestation types=] and [=attestation statement
formats=], while [=[RPS]=] will decide what [=attestation types=] are acceptable to them by policy. [=[RPS]=] will also need to
understand the characteristics of the [=authenticators=] that they trust, based on information they have about these
[=authenticators=]. For example, the FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]] provides one way to access such information.


### Attestation data ### {#sec-attestation-data}

<dfn>Attestation data</dfn> is added to the [=authenticator data=] when generating an [=attestation object=] for a given
credential. It has the following format:

<table class="complex data longlastcol">
    <tr>
        <th>Length (in bytes)</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>The AAGUID of the authenticator.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>Byte length L of Credential ID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>L</td>
        <td>Credential ID</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>variable</td>
        <td>
            Credential public key encoded in CBOR format. This is a CBOR map defined by the following CDDL rules:

            ```
            pubKey = $pubKeyFmt

            ; All public key formats must include an alg name
            pubKeyTemplate = { alg: text }
            pubKeyTemplate .within $pubKeyFmt

            pubKeyFmt /= rsaPubKey
            rsaPubKey = { alg: rsaAlgName, n: biguint, e: uint }
            rsaAlgName = "RS256" / "RS384" / "RS512" / "PS256" / "PS384" / "PS512"

            pubKeyFmt /= eccPubKey
            eccPubKey = { alg: eccAlgName, x: biguint, y: biguint }
            eccAlgName = "ES256" / "ES384" / "ES512"
            ```

            Thus, each public key type is a CBOR map starting with an entry named `alg`, which contains a text string that
            specifies the name of the signature algorithm associated with the credential private key, using values defined in
            [[!RFC7518]] section 3.1. The semantics and naming of the other fields (though not their encoding) follows the
            definitions in [[!RFC7518]] section 6. Specifically, for ECC keys, the semantics of the `x` and `y` fields are
            defined in [[!RFC7518]] sections 6.2.1.2 and 6.2.1.3, while for RSA keys, the semantics of the `n` and `e` fields
            are defined in [[!RFC7518]] sections 6.3.1.1 and 6.3.1.2.

### Attestation Statement Formats ### {#attestation-formats}

As described above, an [=attestation statement format=] is a data format which represents a cryptographic signature by an
[=authenticator=] over a set of contextual bindings. Each [=attestation statement format=] MUST be defined using the following
template:

- <strong>[=Attestation statement format identifier=]:</strong>

- <strong>Supported [=attestation types=]:</strong>

- <strong>Syntax:</strong>
    The syntax of an [=attestation statement=] produced in this format, defined using [[!CDDL]] for the extension point
    `$attStmtFormat` defined in [[#generating-an-attestation-object]].

- <dfn>Signing procedure</dfn>:
    The [=signing procedure=] for computing an [=attestation statement=] in this [=attestation statement format|format=] given
    the [=public key credential=] to be attested, the [=authenticator data=] structure containing the <dfn>authenticator data
    for the attestation</dfn>, and the [=hash of the serialized client data=].

- <dfn>Verification procedurs</dfn>:
    The procedure for verifying an [=attestation statement=], which takes as inputs the [=authenticator data=] structure
    containing the <dfn>authenticator data claimed to have been used for the attestation</dfn> and the [=hash of the serialized
    client data=], and returns either:
    - An error indicating that the attestation is invalid, or
    - The attestation type, and the trust path of the attestation. This trust path is either empty (in case of
        [=self attestation=]), an identifier of a [=ECDAA-Issuer public key=] (in the case of [=ECDAA=]), or a set of X.509
        certificates.

The initial list of specified [=attestation statement formats=] is in [[#defined-attestation-formats]].


<!-- Editors Note: differentiating section IDs from non-section IDs is useful because at times we need to seperately reference
     different things having the same nominal name, eg attestation-types-the-section, and attestation-types-the-definition -->
### Attestation Types ### {#sctn-attestation-types}

WebAuthn supports multiple attestation types:

: <dfn>Basic Attestation</dfn>
:: In the case of basic attestation [[UAFProtocol]], the authenticator's attestation key pair is specific to an
    authenticator model.  Thus, authenticators of the same model often share the same attestation key pair. See
    [[#sec-attestation-privacy]] for futher information.

: <dfn>Self Attestation</dfn>
:: In the case of [=self attestation=], also known as surrogate basic attestation [[UAFProtocol]], the Authenticator doesn't have
    any specific attestation key. Instead it uses the authentication key itself to create the attestation signature.
    Authenticators without meaningful protection measures for an attestation private key typically use this attestation type.

: <dfn>Privacy CA</dfn>
:: In this case, the Authenticator owns an authenticator-specific (endorsement) key. This key is used to securely communicate
    with a trusted third party, the Privacy CA.  The Authenticator can generate multiple attestation key pairs and asks the
    Privacy CA to issue an attestation certificate for it. Using this approach, the Authenticator can limit the exposure of the
    endorsement key (which is a global correlation handle) to Privacy CA(s). Attestation keys can be requested for each [=public
    key credential=] individually.

    Note: This concept typically leads to multiple attestation certificates. The attestation certificate requested most recently
        is called "active".

: <dfn>Elliptic Curve based Direct Anonymous Attestation</dfn> (<dfn>ECDAA</dfn>)
:: In this case, the Authenticator receives direct anonymous attestation (<dfn>DAA</dfn>]) credentials from a single DAA-Issuer.
    These DAA credentials are used along with blinding to sign the [=attestation data=]. The concept of blinding avoids the DAA
    credentials being misused as global correlation handle. WebAuthn supports DAA using elliptic curve cryptography and bilinear
    pairings, called [=ECDAA=] (see [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]) in this specification. Consequently we denote the DAA-Issuer as
    ECDAA-Issuer (see [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).


### Generating an Attestation Object ### {#generating-an-attestation-object}

This section specifies the algorithm for generating an [=attestation object=] (see: [Figure 3](#fig-attStructs)) for any
[=attestation statement format=].

In order to construct an [=attestation object=] for a given [=public key credential=] using a particular [=attestation statement
format=], the [=authenticator=] MUST first generate the [=authenticator data=].

The [=authenticator=] MUST then run the signing procedure for the desired attestation statement format with this
[=authenticator data=] and the [=hash of the serialized client data=] as input, and use this to construct an attestation
statement in that attestation statement format.

Finally, the authenticator MUST construct the [=attestation object=] as a CBOR map with the following syntax:

```
attObj = {
            authData: bytes,
            $$attStmtType
         }

attStmtTemplate = (
                      fmt: text,
                      attStmt: bytes
                  )

; Every attestation statement format must have the above fields
attStmtTemplate .within $$attStmtType
```

The semantics of the fields in the [=attestation object=] are as follows:

: fmt
:: The [=attestation statement format identifier=] associated with the attestation statement. Each attestation statement
    format defines its identifier.

: authData
:: The [=authenticator data=] used to generate the attestation statement.

: attStmt
:: The attestation statement constructed above. The syntax of this is defined by the attestation statement format used.


### Security Considerations ### {#sec-attestation-security-considerations}


#### Privacy #### {#sec-attestation-privacy}

Attestation keys may be used to track users or link various online identities of the same user together. This may be mitigated
in several ways, including:

- A WebAuthn [=authenticator=] manufacturer may choose to ship all of their devices with the same (or a fixed number of)
    attestation key(s) (called [=Basic Attestation=]). This will anonymize the user at the risk of not being able to revoke a
    particular attestation key should its WebAuthn Authenticator be compromised.

- A WebAuthn Authenticator may be capable of dynamically generating different attestation keys (and requesting related
    certificates) per [=origin=] (following the [=Privacy CA=] approach). For example, a WebAuthn Authenticator can ship with a
    master attestation key (and certificate), and combined with a cloud operated privacy CA, can dynamically generate per
    [=origin=] attestation keys and attestation certificates.

- A WebAuthn Authenticator can implement [=Elliptic Curve based direct anonymous attestation=] (see [[FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).
    Using this scheme, the authenticator generates a blinded attestation signature. This allows the [=[RP]=] to verify the
    signature using the [=ECDAA-Issuer public key=], but the attestation signature doesn't serve as a global correlation handle.


#### Attestation Certificate and Attestation Certificate CA Compromise #### {#ca-compromise}

When an intermediate CA or a root CA used for issuing attestation certificates is compromised, WebAuthn [=authenticator=]
attestation keys are still safe although their certificates can no longer be trusted. A WebAuthn Authenticator manufacturer that
has recorded the public attestation keys for their devices can issue new attestation certificates for these keys from a new
intermediate CA or from a new root CA. If the root CA changes, the [=[RPS]=]  must update their trusted root certificates
accordingly.

A WebAuthn Authenticator attestation certificate must be revoked by the issuing CA if its key has been compromised. A WebAuthn
Authenticator manufacturer may need to ship a firmware update and inject new attestation keys and certificates into already
manufactured WebAuthn Authenticators, if the exposure was due to a firmware flaw. (The process by which this happens is out of
scope for this specification.) If the WebAuthn Authenticator manufacturer does not have this capability, then it may not be
possible for [=[RPS]=] to trust any further attestation statements from the affected WebAuthn Authenticators.

If attestation certificate validation fails due to a revoked intermediate attestation CA certificate, and the [=[RP]=]'s policy
requires rejecting the registration/authentication request in these situations, then it is recommended that the [=[RP]=] also
un-registers (or marks with a trust level equivalent to "[=self attestation=]") [=public key credentials=] that were registered
after the CA compromise date using an attestation certificate chaining up to the same intermediate CA. It is thus recommended
that [=[RPS]=] remember intermediate attestation CA certificates during Authenticator registration in order to un-register
related [=public key credentials=] if the registration was performed after revocation of such certificates.

If an [=ECDAA=] attestation key has been compromised, it can be added to the RogueList (i.e., the list of revoked
authenticators) maintained by the related ECDAA-Issuer. The [=[RP]=] should verify whether an authenticator belongs to the
RogueList when performing ECDAA-Verify (see section 3.6 in [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]). For example, the FIDO Metadata Service
[[FIDOMetadataService]] provides one way to access such information.


#### Attestation Certificate Hierarchy #### {#cert-hierarchy}

A 3-tier hierarchy for attestation certificates is recommended (i.e., Attestation Root, Attestation Issuing CA, Attestation
Certificate). It is also recommended that for each WebAuthn Authenticator device line (i.e., model), a separate issuing CA is
used to help facilitate isolating problems with a specific version of a device.

If the attestation root certificate is not dedicated to a single WebAuthn Authenticator device line (i.e., AAGUID), the AAGUID
should be specified in the attestation certificate itself, so that it can be verified against the [=authenticator data=].


# [=[RP]=] Operations # {#rp-operations}

Upon successful execution of {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} or {{CredentialsContainer/get()}}, the [=[RP]=]'s script receives
a {{PublicKeyCredential}} containing an {{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse}} or {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse}} structure,
respectively, from the client. It must then deliver the contents of this structure to the [=[RP]=] server, using methods outside
the scope of this specification. This section describes the operations that the [=[RP]=] must perform upon receipt of these
structures.


## Registering a new credential ## {#registering-a-new-credential}

When registering a new credential, represented by a {{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse}} structure, as part of a
[=registration=] [=ceremony=], a [=[RP]=] MUST proceed as follows:

1. Perform JSON deserialization on the {{AuthenticatorResponse/clientDataJSON}} field of the
    {{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse}} object to extract the [=client data=] |C| claimed as collected during the credential
    creation.

2. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/challenge}} in |C| matches the challenge that was sent to the authenticator in the
    {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} call.

3. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/origin}} in |C| matches the [=[RP]=]'s [=origin=].

4. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/tokenBindingId}} in |C| matches the [=Token Binding ID=] for the TLS connection over
    which the attestation was obtained.

5. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/clientExtensions}} in |C| is a proper subset of the extensions requested by the RP
    and that the {{CollectedClientData/authenticatorExtensions}} in |C| is also a proper subset of the extensions requested by
    the RP.

6. Compute the hash of {{AuthenticatorResponse/clientDataJSON}} using the algorithm identified by
    <code>|C|.{{CollectedClientData/hashAlgorithm}}</code>.

7. Perform CBOR decoding on the {{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse/attestationObject}} field of the
    {{AuthenticatorAttestationResponse}} structure to obtain the attestation statement format |fmt|, the [=authenticator data=]
    |authData|, and the attestation statement |attStmt|.

8. Verify that the [=RP ID=] hash in |authData| is indeed the SHA-256 hash of the [=RP ID=] expected by the RP.

9. Determine the attestation statement format by performing an USASCII case-sensitive match on |fmt| against the set of
    supported WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier values.
    The up-to-date list of registered WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format Identifier values
    is maintained in the in the IANA registry of the same name [[!WebAuthn-Registries]].

10. Verify that |attStmt| is a correct, validly-signed attestation statement, using the attestation statement format |fmt|'s
    verification procedure given [=authenticator data=] |authData| and the [=hash of the serialized client data=] computed in
    step 6.

11. If validation is successful, obtain a list of acceptable trust anchors (attestation root certificates or [=ECDAA-Issuer
    public key=]s) for that attestation type and attestation statement format |fmt|, from a trusted source or from policy. For
    example, the FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]] provides one way to obtain such information, using the AAGUID in
    the [=attestation data=] contained in |authData|.

12. Assess the attestation trustworthiness using the outputs of the verification procedure in step 10, as follows:
        - If [=self attestation=] was used, check if [=self attestation=] is acceptable under [=[RP]=] policy.
        - If [=ECDAA=] was used, verify that the [=identifier of the ECDAA-Issuer public key=] used is included in the set of
            acceptable trust anchors obtained in step 11.
        - Otherwise, use the X.509 certificates returned by the verification procedure to verify that the attestation public key
            correctly chains up to an acceptable root certificate.

13. If the attestation statement |attStmt| verified successfully and is found to be trustworthy, then register the new
    credential with the account that was denoted in the
    {{PublicKeyCredential/[[Create]](options)/options}}.{{MakeCredentialOptions/user}} passed to
    {{CredentialsContainer/create()}}, by associating it with the credential ID and credential public key contained in
    |authData|'s [=attestation data=], as appropriate for the [=[RP]=]'s systems.

14. If the attestation statement |attStmt| successfully verified but is not trustworthy per step 12 above, the [=[RP]=] SHOULD fail
    the registration ceremony.

    NOTE: However, if permitted by policy, the [=[RP]=] MAY register the credential ID and credential public key but treat the
        credential as one with [=self attestation=] (see [[#sctn-attestation-types]]). If doing so, the [=[RP]=] is asserting there
        is no cryptographic proof that the [=public key credential=] has been generated by a particular [=authenticator=] model.
        See [[FIDOSecRef]] and [[UAFProtocol]] for a more detailed discussion.

15. If verification of the attestation statement failed, the [=[RP]=] MUST fail the registration ceremony.

Verification of [=attestation objects=] requires that the [=[RP]=] has a trusted method of determining acceptable trust anchors
in step 11 above. Also, if certificates are being used, the [=[RP]=] must have access to certificate status information for the
intermediate CA certificates. The [=[RP]=] must also be able to build the attestation certificate chain if the client did not
provide this chain in the attestation information.

To avoid ambiguity during authentication, the [=[RP]=] SHOULD check that each credential is registered to no more than one user.
If registration is requested for a credential that is already registered to a different user, the [=[RP]=] SHOULD fail this
ceremony, or it MAY decide to accept the registration, e.g. while deleting the older registration.


## Verifying an authentication assertion ## {#verifying-assertion}

In an [=authentication=] [=ceremony=], the [=[RP]=] MUST proceed as follows in order to verify a given {{PublicKeyCredential}} structure (|credential|) with PublicKeyCredentialType:

    <dl class="switch">
    <dt><a>public-key</a></dt>
    <dd>
1. Using |credential|'s {{Credential/id}} attribute (or the corresponding {{PublicKeyCredential/rawId}}, if
    [=base64url encoding=] is inappropriate for your use case), look up the corresponding credential public key.

2. Let |cData|, |aData| and |sig| denote the value of |credential|'s {{PublicKeyCredential/response}}'s
    {{AuthenticatorResponse/clientDataJSON}}, {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse/authenticatorData}}, and
    {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse/signature}} respectively.

3. Perform JSON deserialization on |cData| to extract the [=client data=] |C| used for the signature.

4. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/challenge}} member of |C| matches the challenge that was sent to the authenticator in
    the {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions}} passed to the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} call.

5. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/origin}} member of |C| matches the [=[RP]=]'s [=origin=].

6. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/tokenBindingId}} member of |C| (if present) matches the [=Token Binding ID=] for the
    TLS connection over which the signature was obtained.

7. Verify that the {{CollectedClientData/clientExtensions}} member of |C| is a proper subset of the extensions requested by the
    [=[RP]=] and that the {{CollectedClientData/authenticatorExtensions}} in |C| is also a proper subset of the extensions
    requested by the [=[RP]=].

8. Verify that the [=RP ID=] hash in |aData| is the SHA-256 hash of the [=RP ID=] expected by the [=[RP]=].

9. Let |hash| be the result of computing a hash over the |cData| using the algorithm represented by the
    {{CollectedClientData/hashAlgorithm}} member of |C|.

10. Using the credential public key looked up in step 1, verify that |sig| is a valid signature over the binary concatenation of
    |aData| and |hash|.

11. If all the above steps are successful, continue with the authentication ceremony as appropriate. Otherwise, fail the
    authentication ceremony.
    </dd>		   
    <dt><a>public-key-uaf</a></dt>
    <dd>
1. Using |credential|'s {{Credential/id}} attribute (or the corresponding {{PublicKeyCredential/rawId}}, if
    [=base64url encoding=] is inappropriate for your use case), look up the corresponding credential public key.

2. Let |cData|, |aData| and |sig| denote the value of |credential|'s {{PublicKeyCredential/response}}'s
    {{AuthenticatorResponse/clientDataJSON}}, {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse/authenticatorData}}, and
    {{AuthenticatorAssertionResponse/signature}} respectively.

3. Perform JSON deserialization on |cData| to extract the [=client data=] |C| used for the signature.

4. Perform the verification as described in [[FIDO-UAF-Protocol]] section 3.5.7.5.

5. If all the above steps are successful, continue with the authentication ceremony as appropriate. Otherwise, fail the
    authentication ceremony.
    </dd>
    </dl>

# Defined Attestation Statement Formats # {#defined-attestation-formats}

WebAuthn supports pluggable attestation statement formats. This section defines an initial set of such formats.

## Attestation Statement Format Identifiers ## {#sctn-attstn-fmt-ids}

Attestation statement formats are identified by a string, called a <dfn>attestation statement format identifier</dfn>, chosen by
the author of the attestation statement format.

Attestation statement format identifiers SHOULD be registered per [[!WebAuthn-Registries]] "Registries for Web Authentication
(WebAuthn)". All registered attestation statement format identifiers are unique amongst themselves as a matter of course.

Unregistered attestation statement format identifiers SHOULD use lowercase reverse domain-name naming, using a domain name
registered by the developer, in order to assure uniqueness of the identifier. All attestation statement format identifiers MUST
be a maximum of 32 octets in length and MUST consist only of printable USASCII characters, excluding backslash and doublequote,
i.e., VCHAR as defined in [[!RFC5234]] but without %x22 and %x5c.

Note: This means attestation statement format identifiers based on domain names MUST incorporate only LDH Labels [[!RFC5890]].

Implementations MUST match WebAuthn attestation statement format identifiers in a case-sensitive fashion.

Attestation statement formats that may exist in multiple versions SHOULD include a version in their identifier. In effect,
different versions are thus treated as different formats, e.g., `packed2` as a new version of the `packed` attestation statement
format.

The following sections present a set of currently-defined and registered attestation statement formats and their identifiers.
The up-to-date list of registered WebAuthn Extensions is maintained in the IANA "WebAuthn Attestation Statement Format
Identifier" registry established by [[!WebAuthn-Registries]].

## Packed Attestation Statement Format ## {#packed-attestation}

This is a WebAuthn optimized attestation statement format. It uses a very compact but still extensible encoding method. It is
implementable by [=authenticators=] with limited resources (e.g., secure elements).

: Attestation statement format identifier
:: packed

: Attestation types supported
:: All

: Syntax
:: The syntax of a Packed Attestation statement is defined by the following CDDL:

    ```
    $$attStmtType //= (
                          fmt: "packed",
                          attStmt: packedStmtFormat
                      )

    packedStmtFormat = {
                           alg: rsaAlgName / eccAlgName,
                           sig: bytes,
                           x5c: [ attestnCert: bytes, * (caCert: bytes) ]
                       } //
                       {
                           alg: "ED256" / "ED512",
                           sig: bytes,
                           ecdaaKeyId: bytes
                       }
    ```

    The semantics of the fields are as follows:

    : alg
    :: A text string containing the name of the algorithm used to generate the attestation signature. The types `rsaAlgName` and
        `eccAlgName` are as defined in [[#sec-attestation-data]]. "ED256" and "ED512" refer to algorithms defined in
        [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]].

    : sig
    :: A byte string containing the attestation signature.

    : x5c
    :: The elements of this array contain the attestation certificate and its certificate chain, each encoded in X.509 format.
        The attestation certificate must be the first element in the array.

    : ecdaaKeyId
    :: The <dfn>identifier of the ECDAA-Issuer public key</dfn>.  This is the
        BigNumberToB encoding of the component "c" of the <dfn>ECDAA-Issuer public key</dfn>
        as defined section 3.3, step 3.5 in [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]].

: Signing procedure
:: The signing procedure for this attestation statement format is similar to [the procedure for generating assertion
    signatures](#fig-signature).

    Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data for the attestation=], and let |clientDataHash| denote the
    [=hash of the serialized client data=].

    If Basic or Privacy CA attestation is in use, the authenticator produces the |sig| by concatenating |authenticatorData| and
    |clientDataHash|, and signing the result using an attestation private key selected through an authenticator-specific
    mechanism. It sets |x5c| to the certificate chain of the attestation public key and |alg| to the algorithm of the
    attestation private key.

    If [=ECDAA=] is in use, the authenticator produces |sig| by concatenating |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash|, and
    signing the result using ECDAA-Sign (see section 3.5 of [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]) with a [=ECDAA-Issuer public key=] selected
    through an authenticator-specific mechanism (see [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]). It sets |alg| to the algorithm of the
    [=ECDAA-Issuer public key=] and |ecdaaKeyId| to the [=identifier of the ECDAA-Issuer public key=] (see above).

    If [=self attestation=] is in use, the authenticator produces |sig| by concatenating |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash|,
    and signing the result using the credential private key. It sets |alg| to the algorithm of the credential private key, and
    omits the other fields.

: Verification procedure
:: Verify that the given attestation statement is valid CBOR conforming to the syntax defined above.

    Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data claimed to have been used for the attestation=], and let
    |clientDataHash| denote the [=hash of the serialized client data=].

    If |x5c| is present, this indicates that the attestation type is not [=ECDAA=]. In this case:
    - Verify that |sig| is a valid signature over the concatenation of |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash| using the
        attestation public key in |x5c| with the algorithm specified in |alg|.
    - Verify that |x5c| meets the requirements in [[#packed-attestation-cert-requirements]].
    - If |x5c| contains an extension with OID `1 3 6 1 4 1 45724 1 1 4` (id-fido-gen-ce-aaguid) verify that the value of this
        extension matches the AAGUID in |authenticatorData|.
    - If successful, return attestation type Basic and trust path |x5c|.

    If |ecdaaKeyId| is present, then the attestation type is ECDAA. In this case:
    - Verify that |sig| is a valid signature over the concatenation of |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash| using
        ECDAA-Verify with [=ECDAA-Issuer public key=] identified by |ecdaaKeyId| (see [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).
    - If successful, return attestation type ECDAA and trust path |ecdaaKeyId|.

    If neither |x5c| nor |ecdaaKeyId| is present, [=self attestation=] is in use.
    - Validate that |alg| matches the algorithm of the credential private key in |authenticatorData|.
    - Verify that |sig| is a valid signature over the concatenation of |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash| using the
        credential public key with |alg|.
    - If successful, return attestation type Self and empty trust path.


### Packed attestation statement certificate requirements ### {#packed-attestation-cert-requirements}

The attestation certificate MUST have the following fields/extensions:

- Version must be set to 3.
- Subject field MUST be set to:
    : Subject-C
    :: Country where the Authenticator vendor is incorporated
    : Subject-O
    :: Legal name of the Authenticator vendor
    : Subject-OU
    :: Authenticator Attestation
    : Subject-CN
    :: No stipulation.

- If the related attestation root certificate is used for multiple authenticator models, the Extension OID
    `1 3 6 1 4 1 45724 1 1 4` (id-fido-gen-ce-aaguid) MUST be present, containing the AAGUID as value.

- The Basic Constraints extension MUST have the CA component set to false

- An Authority Information Access (AIA) extension with entry `id-ad-ocsp` and a CRL Distribution Point extension [[RFC5280]]
    are both optional as the status of many attestation certificates is available through authenticator metadata services.
    See, for example, the FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]].


## TPM Attestation Statement Format ## {#tpm-attestation}

This attestation statement format is generally used by authenticators that use a Trusted Platform Module as their cryptographic
engine.

: Attestation statement format identifier
:: tpm

: Attestation types supported
:: Privacy CA, ECDAA

: Syntax
:: The syntax of a TPM Attestation statement is as follows:

    ```
    $$attStmtType // = (
                           fmt: "tpm",
                           attStmt: tpmStmtFormat
                       )

    tpmStmtFormat = {

                            x5c: [ aikCert: bytes, * (caCert: bytes) ]
                        ) //
                        (
                            alg:  "ED256" / "ED512",

                        pubArea: bytes
                    }
    ```

    The semantics of the above fields are as follows:

    : ver
    :: The version of the TPM specification to which the signature conforms.

    : alg
    :: The name of the algorithm used to generate the attestation signature. The types `rsaAlgName` and `eccAlgNAme` are as
        defined in [[#sec-attestation-data]]. The types "ED256" and "ED512" refer to the algorithms specified in
        [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]].

    : x5c
    :: The AIK certificate used for the attestation and its certificate chain, in X.509 encoding.

    : ecdaaKeyId
    :: The [=identifier of the ECDAA-Issuer public key=]. This is the
        BigNumberToB encoding of the component "c" as defined section 3.3,

    : sig
    :: The attestation signature, in the form of a TPMT_SIGNATURE structure as specified in [[TPMv2-Part2]] section 11.3.4.

    : certInfo
    :: The TPMS_ATTEST structure over which the above signature was computed, as specified in [[TPMv2-Part2]] section 10.12.8.

    : pubArea
    :: The TPMT_PUBLIC structure (see [[TPMv2-Part2]] section 12.2.4) used by the TPM to represent the credential public key.

: Signing procedure
:: Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data for the attestation=], and let |clientDataHash| denote the
    [=hash of the serialized client data=].

    Concatenate |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash| to form |attToBeSigned|.

    Generate a signature using the procedure specified in [[TPMv2-Part3]] Section 18.2, using the attestation private key and
    setting the `qualifyingData` parameter to |attToBeSigned|.

    Set the |pubArea| field to the public area of the credential public key, the |certInfo| field to the output parameter of the
    same name, and the |sig| field to the signature obtained from the above procedure.

: Verification procedure
:: Verify that the given attestation statement is valid CBOR conforming to the syntax defined above.

    Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data claimed to have been used for the attestation=], and let
    |clientDataHash| denote the [=hash of the serialized client data=].

    Verify that the public key specified by the `parameters` and `unique` fields of |pubArea| is identical to the public key
    contained in the [=attestation data=] inside |authenticatorData|.

    Concatenate |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash| to form |attToBeSigned|.

    Validate that |certInfo| is valid:
    - Verify that `magic` is set to `TPM_GENERATED_VALUE`.
    - Verify that `type` is set to `TPM_ST_ATTEST_CERTIFY`.
    - Verify that `extraData` is set to |attToBeSigned|.
    - Verify that `attested` contains a `TPMS_CERTIFY_INFO` structure, whose `name` field contains a valid Name for |pubArea|,
        as computed using the algorithm in the `nameAlg` field of |pubArea| using the procedure specified in [[TPMv2-Part1]]
        section 16.

    If |x5c| is present, this indicates that the attestation type is not [=ECDAA=]. In this case:
    - Verify the |sig| is a valid signature over |certInfo| using the attestation public key in |x5c| with the
        algorithm specified in |alg|.
    - Verify that |x5c| meets the requirements in [[#tpm-cert-requirements]].
    - If |x5c| contains an extension with OID `1 3 6 1 4 1 45724 1 1 4` (id-fido-gen-ce-aaguid) verify that the value of this
        extension matches the AAGUID in |authenticatorData|.
    - If successful, return attestation type Privacy CA and trust path |x5c|.

    If |ecdaaKeyId| is present, then the attestation type is [=ECDAA=].
    - Perform ECDAA-Verify on |sig| to verify that it is a valid signature over |certInfo| (see [[!FIDOEcdaaAlgorithm]]).
    - If successful, return attestation type ECDAA and the [=identifier of the ECDAA-Issuer public key=] |ecdaaKeyId|.


### TPM attestation statement certificate requirements ### {#tpm-cert-requirements}

TPM [=attestation certificate=] MUST have the following fields/extensions:

- Version must be set to 3.

- Subject field MUST be set to empty.

- The Subject Alternative Name extension must be set as defined in [[TPMv2-EK-Profile]] section 3.2.9.

- The Extended Key Usage extension MUST contain the
    "joint-iso-itu-t(2) internationalorganizations(23) 133 tcg-kp(8) tcg-kp-AIKCertificate(3)" OID.

- The Basic Constraints extension MUST have the CA component set to false.

- An Authority Information Access (AIA) extension with entry `id-ad-ocsp` and a CRL Distribution Point extension [[RFC5280]] are
    both optional as the status of many attestation certificates is available through metadata services.
    See, for example, the FIDO Metadata Service [[FIDOMetadataService]].


## Android Key Attestation Statement Format ## {#android-key-attestation}

When the [=authenticator=] in question is a platform-provided Authenticator on the Android "N" or later platform, the
attestation statement is based on the [Android key
attestation](https://developer.android.com/preview/api-overview.html#key_attestation). In these cases, the attestation statement
is produced by a component running in a secure operating environment, but the [=authenticator data for the attestation=] is
produced outside this environment. The [=[RP]=] is expected to check that the [=authenticator data claimed to have been used for
the attestation=] is consistent with the fields of the attestation certificate's extension data.


: Attestation statement format identifier
:: android-key

: Attestation types supported
:: Basic

: Syntax
:: An Android key attestation statement consists simply of the Android attestation statement, which is a series of
    DER encoded X.509 certificates. See
    [the Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-key-attestation.html). Its
    syntax is defined as follows:

    ```
    $$attStmtType //= (
                          fmt: "android-key",
                          attStmt: androidStmtFormat
                      )

    androidStmtFormat = bytes
    ```

: Signing procedure
:: Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data for the attestation=], and let |clientDataHash| denote the
    [=hash of the serialized client data=].

    Concatenate |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash| to form |attToBeSigned|.

    Request an Android Key Attestation by calling "keyStore.getCertificateChain(myKeyUUID)") providing |attToBeSigned| as the
    challenge value (e.g., by using <a
    href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder.html#setAttestationChallenge(byte%5B%5D)">
    setAttestationChallenge</a>), and set the attestation statement to the returned value.

: Verification procedure
:: Verification is performed as follows:
    - Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data claimed to have been used for the attestation=], and let
        |clientDataHash| denote the [=hash of the serialized client data=].
    - Verify that the public key in the first certificate in the series of certificates represented by the signature matches the
        [=credential public key=] in the [=attestation data=] field of |authenticatorData|.
    - Verify that in the attestation certificate extension data:
        - The value of the `attestationChallenge` field is identical to the concatenation of |authenticatorData| and
            |clientDataHash|.
        - The `AuthorizationList.allApplications` field is <em>not</em> present, since PublicKeyCredentials must be bound to the
            [=RP ID=].
        - The value in the `AuthorizationList.origin` field is equal to `KM_TAG_GENERATED`.
        - The value in the `AuthorizationList.purpose` field is equal to `KM_PURPOSE_SIGN`.
    - If successful, return attestation type Basic with the trust path set to the entire attestation statement.


## Android SafetyNet Attestation Statement Format ## {#android-safetynet-attestation}

When the [=authenticator=] in question is a platform-provided Authenticator on certain Android platforms, the attestation
statement is based on the [SafetyNet API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response). In
this case the [=authenticator data=] is completely controlled by the caller of the SafetyNet API (typically an application
running on the Android platform) and the attestation statement only provides some statements about the health of the platform
and the identity of the calling application.

: Attestation statement format identifier
:: android-safetynet

: Attestation types supported
:: Basic

: Syntax
:: The syntax of an Android Attestation statement is defined as follows:

    ```
    $$attStmtType //= (
                          fmt: "android-safetynet",
                          attStmt: safetynetStmtFormat
                      )

    safetynetStmtFormat = {
                              ver: text,
                              response: bytes
                          }
    ```

    The semantics of the above fields are as follows:

    : ver
    :: The version number of Google Play Services responsible for providing the SafetyNet API.

    : response
    :: The value returned by the above SafetyNet API. This value is a JWS [[RFC7515]] object (see
        [SafetyNet online documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response))
        in Compact Serialization.

: Signing procedure
:: Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data for the attestation=], and let |clientDataHash| denote the
    [=hash of the serialized client data=].

    Concatenate |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash| to form |attToBeSigned|.

    Request a SafetyNet attestation, providing |attToBeSigned| as the nonce value. Set |response| to the result, and |ver| to
    the version of Google Play Services running in the authenticator.

: Verification procedure
:: Verification is performed as follows:
    - Verify that the given attestation statement is valid CBOR conforming to the syntax defined above.
    - Verify that |response| is a valid SafetyNet response of version |ver|.
    - Verify that the nonce in the |response| is identical to the concatenation of the |authenticatorData| and |clientDataHash|.
    - Verify that the attestation certificate is issued to the hostname "attest.android.com" (see
        [SafetyNet online documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#compat-check-response)).
    - Verify that the `ctsProfileMatch` attribute in the payload of |response| is true.
    - If successful, return attestation type Basic with the trust path set to the above attestation certificate.


## FIDO U2F Attestation Statement Format ## {#fido-u2f-attestation}

This attestation statement format is used with FIDO U2F authenticators using the formats defined in
[[FIDO-U2F-Message-Formats]].

: Attestation statement format identifier
:: fido-u2f

: Attestation types supported
:: Basic, [=self attestation=]

: Syntax
:: The syntax of a FIDO U2F attestation statement is defined as follows:

    ```
    $$attStmtType //= (
                          fmt: "fido-u2f",
                          attStmt: u2fStmtFormat
                      )

    u2fStmtFormat = {
                        x5c: [ attestnCert: bytes, * (caCert: bytes) ],
                        sig: bytes
                    }
    ```

    The semantics of the above fields are as follows:

    : x5c
    :: The elements of this array contain the attestation certificate and its certificate chain, each encoded in X.509 format.
        The attestation certificate must be the first element in the array.

    : sig
    :: The [=attestation signature=].

: Signing procedure
:: If the credential public key of the given credential is not of algorithm "ES256", stop and return an error.

    Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data for the attestation=], and let |clientDataHash| denote the
    [=hash of the serialized client data=].

    If |clientDataHash| is 256 bits long, set |tbsHash| to this value. Otherwise set |tbsHash| to the SHA-256 hash of
    |clientDataHash|.

    Generate a signature as specified in [[FIDO-U2F-Message-Formats]] section 4.3, with the application parameter set to the
    SHA-256 hash of the [=RP ID=] associated with the given credential, the challenge parameter set to |tbsHash|, and the key handle
    parameter set to the credential ID of the given credential. Set this as |sig| and set the attestation certificate of
    the attestation public key as |x5c|.

: Verification procedure
:: Verification is performed as follows:
    - Verify that the given attestation statement is valid CBOR conforming to the syntax defined above.
    - If |x5c| is not a certificate for an ECDSA public key over the P-256 curve, stop verification and return an error.
    - Let |authenticatorData| denote the [=authenticator data claimed to have been used for the attestation=], and let
        |clientDataHash| denote the [=hash of the serialized client data=].
    - If |clientDataHash| is 256 bits long, set |tbsHash| to this value. Otherwise set |tbsHash| to the SHA-256
        hash of |clientDataHash|.
    - From |authenticatorData|, extract the claimed [=RP ID=] hash, the claimed credential ID and the claimed credential public key.
    - Generate the claimed to-be-signed data as specified in [[FIDO-U2F-Message-Formats]] section 4.3, with the application
        parameter set to the claimed [=RP ID=] hash, the challenge parameter set to |tbsHash|, the key handle parameter set to the
        claimed credential ID of the given credential, and the user public key parameter set to the claimed credential public
        key.
    - Verify that the |sig| is a valid ECDSA P-256 signature over the to-be-signed data constructed above.
    - If successful, return attestation type Basic with the trust path set to |x5c|.


# WebAuthn Extensions # {#extensions}

The mechanism for generating [=public key credentials=], as well as requesting and generating Authentication assertions, as
defined in [[#api]], can be extended to suit particular use cases. Each case is addressed by defining a <dfn>registration
extension</dfn> and/or an <dfn>authentication extension</dfn>.

Every extension is a <dfn>client extension</dfn>, meaning that the extension involves communication with and processing by the
client.
[=Client extensions=] define the following steps and data:

- {{CredentialsContainer/create()|navigator.credentials.create()}} extension request parameters and response values for [=registration extensions=].

- {{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}} extension request parameters and response values for [=authentication extensions=].

- [=Client extension processing=] for [=registration extensions=] and [=authentication extensions=].

When creating a [=public key credential=] or requesting an [=authentication assertion=], a [=[RP]=] can request the use of a set
of extensions. These extensions will be invoked during the requested operation if they are supported by the client and/or the
authenticator. The [=[RP]=] sends the [=client extension input=] for each extension in the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} call
(for [=authentication extensions=]) or {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} call (for [=registration extensions=]) to the client
platform. The client platform performs [=client extension processing=] for each extension that it supports, and augments the
[=client data=] as specified by each extension, by including the [=extension identifier=] and [=client extension output=]
values.

An extension can also be an <dfn>authenticator extension</dfn>, meaning that the extension invoves communication with and
processing by the authenticator. [=Authenticator extensions=] define the following steps and data:

- [=authenticatorMakeCredential=] extension request parameters and response values for [=registration extensions=].

- [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] extension request parameters and response values for [=authentication extensions=].

- [=Authenticator extension processing=] for [=registration extensions=] and [=authentication extensions=].

For [=authenticator extensions=], as part of the [=client extension processing=], the client also creates the [=CBOR=]
[=authenticator extension input=] value for each extension (often based on the corresponding [=client extension input=] value),
and passes them to the authenticator in the {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} call (for [=registration extensions=]) or the
{{CredentialsContainer/get()}} call (for [=authentication extensions=]). These [=authenticator extension input=] values are
represented in [=CBOR=] and passed as name-value pairs, with the [=extension identifier=] as the name, and the corresponding
[=authenticator extension input=] as the value. The authenticator, in turn, performs additional processing for the extensions
that it supports, and returns the [=CBOR=] [=authenticator extension output=] for each as specified by the extension. Part of
the [=client extension processing=] for [=authenticator extensions=] is to use the [=authenticator extension output=] as an
input to creating the [=client extension output=].

All WebAuthn extensions are optional for both clients and authenticators. Thus, any extensions requested by a [=[RP]=] may be
ignored by the client browser or OS and not passed to the authenticator at all, or they may be ignored by the authenticator.
Ignoring an extension is never considered a failure in WebAuthn API processing, so when [=[RPS]=] include extensions with any
API calls, they must be prepared to handle cases where some or all of those extensions are ignored.

Clients wishing to support the widest possible range of extensions may choose to pass through any extensions that they do not
recognize to authenticators, generating the [=authenticator extension input=] by simply encoding the [=client extension input=]
in CBOR. All WebAuthn extensions MUST be defined in such a way that this implementation choice does not endanger the user's
security or privacy. For instance, if an extension requires client processing, it could be defined in a manner that ensures such
a naïve pass-through will produce a semantically invalid [=authenticator extension input=] value, resulting in the extension
being ignored by the authenticator. Since all extensions are optional, this will not cause a functional failure in the API
operation. Likewise, clients can choose to produce a [=client extension output=] value for an extension that it does not
understand by encoding the [=authenticator extension output=] value into JSON, provided that the CBOR output uses only types
present in JSON.

The IANA "WebAuthn Extension Identifier" registry established by [[!WebAuthn-Registries]] should be consulted
for an up-to-date list of registered WebAuthn Extensions.


## Extension Identifiers ## {#sctn-extension-id}

Extensions are identified by a string, called an <dfn>extension identifier</dfn>, chosen by the extension author.

Extension identifiers SHOULD be registered per [[!WebAuthn-Registries]] "Registries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)".
All registered extension identifiers are unique amongst themselves as a matter of course.

Unregistered extension identifiers should aim to be globally unique, e.g., by including the defining entity such as
`myCompany_extension`.

All extension identifiers MUST be a maximum of 32 octets in length and MUST consist only of printable USASCII characters,
excluding backslash and doublequote, i.e., VCHAR as defined in [[!RFC5234]] but without %x22 and %x5c. Implementations MUST
match WebAuthn extension identifiers in a case-sensitive fashion.

Extensions that may exist in multiple versions should take care to include a version in their identifier. In effect, different
versions are thus treated as different extensions, e.g., `myCompany_extension_01`

[[#sctn-defined-extensions]] defines an initial set of extensions and their identifiers.
See the IANA "WebAuthn Extension Identifier" registry established by [[!WebAuthn-Registries]]
for an up-to-date list of registered WebAuthn Extension Identifiers.


## Defining extensions ## {#sctn-extension-specification}

A definition of an extension must specify an [=extension identifier=], a [=client extension input=] argument
to be sent via the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} or {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} call,
the [=client extension processing=] rules, and a [=client extension output=] value.
If the extension communicates with the authenticator (meaning it is an [=authenticator extension=]),
it must also specify the [=CBOR=] [=authenticator extension input=] argument
sent via the [=authenticatorGetAssertion=] or [=authenticatorMakeCredential=] call,
the [=authenticator extension processing=] rules, and the [=CBOR=] [=authenticator extension output=] value.

Any [=client extension=] that is processed by the client MUST return a [=client extension output=] value so that the [=[RP]=]
knows that the extension was honored by the client. Similarly, any extension that requires authenticator processing MUST return
an [=authenticator extension output=] to let the [=[RP]=] know that the extension was honored by the authenticator. If an
extension does not otherwise require any result values, it SHOULD be defined as returning a JSON Boolean [=client extension
output=] result, set to `true` to signify that the extension was understood and processed. Likewise, any [=authenticator
extension=] that does not otherwise require any result values MUST return a value and SHOULD return a CBOR Boolean
[=authenticator extension output=] result, set to `true` to signify that the extension was understood and processed.

## Extending request parameters ## {#sctn-extension-request-parameters}

An extension defines one or two request arguments. The <dfn>client extension input</dfn>,
which is a value that can be encoded in JSON, is passed from the [=[RP]=] to the client
in the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} or {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} call,
while the [=CBOR=] <dfn>authenticator extension input</dfn> is
passed from the client to the authenticator for [=authenticator extensions=] during the processing of these calls.

A [=[RP]=] simultaneously requests the use of an extension and sets its [=client extension input=] by including an entry in the
{{MakeCredentialOptions/extensions}} option to the {{CredentialsContainer/create()}} or {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} call.
The entry key is the [=extension identifier=] and the value is the [=client extension input=].

<pre class="example" highlight="js">
    var assertionPromise = navigator.credentials.get({
        publicKey: {
            challenge: "...",
            extensions: {
                "webauthnExample_foobar": 42
            }
        }
    });
</pre>

Extension definitions MUST specify the valid values for their [=client extension input=]. Clients SHOULD ignore extensions with
an invalid [=client extension input=]. If an extension does not require any parameters from the [=[RP]=], it SHOULD be defined
as taking a Boolean client argument, set to `true` to signify that the extension is requested by the [=[RP]=].

Extensions that only affect client processing need not specify [=authenticator extension input=]. Extensions that have
authenticator processing MUST specify the method of computing the [=authenticator extension input=] from the [=client extension
input=]. For extensions that do not require input parameters and are defined as taking a Boolean [=client extension input=]
value set to `true`, this method SHOULD consist of passing an [=authenticator extension input=] value of `true` (CBOR major type
7, value 21).

Note: Extensions should aim to define authenticator arguments that are as small as possible. Some authenticators communicate
    over low-bandwidth links such as Bluetooth Low-Energy or NFC.


## <dfn>Client extension processing</dfn> ## {#sctn-client-extension-processing}

Extensions may define additional processing requirements on the client platform during the creation of credentials or the
generation of an assertion. The [=client extension input=] for the extension is used an input to this client processing.
Supported [=client extensions=] are recorded as a dictionary in the [=client data=] with the key
{{CollectedClientData/clientExtensions}}. For each such extension, the client adds an entry to this dictionary with the
[=extension identifier=] as the key, and the extension's [=client extension input=] as the value.

Likewise, the [=client extension outputs=] are represented as a dictionary in the {{PublicKeyCredential/clientExtensionResults}}
with [=extension identifiers=] as keys, and the <dfn>client extension output</dfn> value of each extension as the value.
Like the [=client extension input=], the [=client extension output=] is a value that can be encoded in JSON.

Extensions that require authenticator processing MUST define
the process by which the [=client extension input=] can be used to determine the [=CBOR=] [=authenticator extension input=] and
the process by which the [=CBOR=] [=authenticator extension output=] can be used to determine the [=client extension output=].

## <dfn>Authenticator extension processing</dfn> ## {#sctn-authenticator-extension-processing}

As specified in [[#sec-authenticator-data]], the [=CBOR=] [=authenticator extension input=] value of each processed
[=authenticator extension=] is included in the extensions data part of the [=authenticator data=]. This part is a CBOR map, with
[=CBOR=] [=extension identifier=] values as keys, and the [=CBOR=] [=authenticator extension input=] value of each extension as
the value.

Likewise, the extension output is represented in the [=authenticator data=] as a CBOR map with [=CBOR=] [=extension
identifiers=] as keys, and the [=CBOR=] <dfn>authenticator extension output</dfn> value of each extension as the value.

The [=authenticator extension processing=] rules are used create the [=authenticator extension output=]
from the [=authenticator extension input=], and possibly also other inputs, for each extension.

## Example Extension ## {#sctn-example-extension}

[INFORMATIVE]

To illustrate the requirements above, consider a hypothetical [=registration extension=] and [=authentication extension=] "Geo".
This extension, if supported, enables a geolocation location to be returned from the authenticator or client to the [=[RP]=].

The [=extension identifier=] is chosen as `webauthnExample_geo`. The [=client extension input=] is the constant value `true`,
since the extension does not require the [=[RP]=] to pass any particular information to the client, other than that it requests
the use of the extension. The [=[RP]=] sets this value in its request for an assertion:

<pre highlight="js">
    var assertionPromise =
        navigator.credentials.get({
            publicKey: {
                challenge: "SGFuIFNvbG8gc2hvdCBmaXJzdC4",
                allowCredentials: [], /* Empty filter */
                extensions: { 'webauthnExample_geo': true }
            }
        });
</pre>

The extension also requires the client to set the authenticator parameter to the fixed value `true`.

The extension requires the authenticator to specify its geolocation in the [=authenticator extension output=], if known. The
extension e.g. specifies that the location shall be encoded as a two-element array of floating point numbers, encoded with CBOR.
An authenticator does this by including it in the [=authenticator data=]. As an example, [=authenticator data=] may be as
follows (notation taken from [[RFC7049]]):

<pre>
    81 (hex)                                    -- Flags, ED and TUP both set.
    20 05 58 1F                                 -- Signature counter
    A1                                          -- CBOR map of one element
        73                                      -- Key 1: CBOR text string of 19 bytes
            77 65 62 61 75 74 68 6E 45 78 61
            6D 70 6C 65 5F 67 65 6F             -- "webauthnExample_geo" [=UTF-8 encoded=] string
        82                                      -- Value 1: CBOR array of two elements
            FA 42 82 1E B3                      -- Element 1: Latitude as CBOR encoded float
            FA C1 5F E3 7F                      -- Element 2: Longitude as CBOR encoded float
</pre>

The extension defines the [=client extension output=] to be the geolocation information, if known, as a GeoJSON [[GeoJSON]]
point. The client constructs the following [=client data=]:

<pre highlight="js">
    {
        ...,
        'extensions': {
            'webauthnExample_geo': {
                'type': 'Point',
                'coordinates': [65.059962, -13.993041]
            }
        }
    }
</pre>


# Defined Extensions # {#sctn-defined-extensions}

This section defines the initial set of extensions to be registered in the
IANA "WebAuthn Extension Identifier" registry established by [[!WebAuthn-Registries]].
These are recommended for implementation by user agents targeting broad interoperability.


## FIDO AppId Extension (appid) ## {#sctn-appid-extension}

This [=authentication extension=] allows [=[RPS]=] that have previously registered a
credential using the legacy FIDO JavaScript APIs to request an assertion.
Specifically, this extension allows [=[RPS]=] to specify an |appId| [[FIDO-APPID]]
to overwrite the otherwise computed |rpId|.  This extension is only valid if
used during the {{CredentialsContainer/get()}} call; other usage will result in client
error.

: Extension identifier
:: `appid`

: Client extension input
:: A single JSON string specifying a FIDO |appId|.

: Client extension processing
:: If {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/rpId}} is present, reject promise with a DOMException
    whose name is "{{NotAllowedError}}", and terminate this algorithm.
    Replace the calculation of |rpId| in Step 3 of [[#getAssertion]] with the
    following procedure:  The client uses the value of |appid| to perform
    the AppId validation procedure (as defined by [[FIDO-APPID]]).  If valid,
    the value of |rpId| for all client processing should be replaced by the
    value of |appid|.

: Client extension output
:: Returns the JSON value `true` to indicate to the RP that the extension was acted upon

: Authenticator extension input
:: None.

: Authenticator extension processing
:: None.

: Authenticator extension output
:: None.


## Simple Transaction Authorization Extension (txAuthSimple) ## {#sctn-simple-txauth-extension}

This [=registration extension=] and [=authentication extension=] allows for a simple form of transaction authorization. A
[=[RP]=] can specify a prompt string, intended for display on a trusted device on the authenticator.

: Extension identifier
:: `txAuthSimple`

: Client extension input
:: A single JSON string prompt.

: Client extension processing
:: None, except creating the authenticator extension input from the client extension input.

: Client extension output
:: Returns the authenticator extension output string UTF-8 decoded into a JSON string

: Authenticator extension input
:: The client extension input encoded as a CBOR text string (major type 3).

: Authenticator extension processing
:: The authenticator MUST display the prompt to the user before performing either [=user verification=] or [=test of user
    presence=]. The authenticator may insert line breaks if needed.

: Authenticator extension output
:: A single CBOR string, representing the prompt as displayed (including any eventual line breaks).

## Generic Transaction Authorization Extension (txAuthGeneric) ## {#sctn-generic-txauth-extension}

This [=registration extension=] and [=authentication extension=] allows images to be used as transaction authorization prompts
as well. This allows authenticators without a font rendering engine to be used and also supports a richer visual appearance.

: Extension identifier
:: `txAuthGeneric`

: Client extension input
:: A CBOR map defined as follows:
    ```
    txAuthGenericArg = {
                           contentType: text,   ; MIME-Type of the content, e.g. "image/png"
                           content: bytes
                       }
    ```

: Client extension processing
:: None, except creating the authenticator extension input from the client extension input.

: Client extension output
:: Returns the base64url encoding of the authenticator extension output value as a JSON string

: Authenticator extension input
:: The client extension input encoded as a CBOR map.

: Authenticator extension processing
:: The authenticator MUST display the `content` to the user before performing either [=user verification=] or [=test of
    user presence=]. The authenticator may add other information below the `content`. No changes are allowed to the `content`
    itself, i.e., inside `content` boundary box.

: Authenticator extension output
:: The hash value of the `content` which was displayed. The authenticator MUST use the same hash algorithm as it uses for the
    signature itself.


## Authenticator Selection Extension (authnSel) ## {#sctn-authenticator-selection-extension}

This [=registration extension=] allows a [=[RP]=] to guide the selection of the authenticator that will be leveraged when
creating the credential. It is intended primarily for [=[RPS]=] that wish to tightly control the experience around credential
creation.

: Extension identifier
:: `authnSel`

: Client extension input
:: A sequence of AAGUIDs:

    <xmp class="idl">
        typedef sequence<AAGUID>      AuthenticatorSelectionList;
    </xmp>

    Each AAGUID corresponds to an authenticator model that is acceptable to the [=[RP]=] for this credential creation. The
    list is ordered by decreasing preference.

    An AAGUID is defined as an array containing the globally unique identifier of the authenticator model being sought.

    <pre class="idl">
        typedef BufferSource      AAGUID;
    </pre>

: Client extension processing
:: This extension can only be used during {{CredentialsContainer/create()}}. If the client supports the Authenticator Selection
    Extension, it MUST use the first available authenticator whose AAGUID is present in the {{AuthenticatorSelectionList}}. If
    none of the available authenticators match a provided AAGUID, the client MUST select an authenticator from among the
    available authenticators to generate the credential.

: Client extension output
:: Returns the JSON value `true` to indicate to the RP that the extension was acted upon

: Authenticator extension input
:: None.

: Authenticator extension processing
:: None.

: Authenticator extension output
:: None.

## Supported Extensions Extension (exts) ## {#sctn-supported-extensions-extension}

This [=registration extension=] enables the [=[RP]=] to determine which extensions the authenticator supports.

: Extension identifier
:: `exts`

: Client extension input
:: The Boolean value `true` to indicate that this extension is requested by the [=[RP]=].

: Client extension processing
:: None, except creating the authenticator extension input from the client extension input.

: Client extension output
:: Returns the list of supported extensions as a JSON array of [=extension identifier=] strings

: Authenticator extension input
:: The Boolean value `true`, encoded in CBOR (major type 7, value 21).

: Authenticator extension processing
:: The [=authenticator=] sets the [=authenticator extension output=] to be a list of extensions that the authenticator supports, as
    defined below. This extension can be added to attestation objects.

: Authenticator extension output
:: The SupportedExtensions extension is a list (CBOR array) of [=extension identifier=] ([=UTF-8 encoded=] strings).


## User Verification Index Extension (uvi) ## {#sctn-uvi-extension}

This [=registration extension=] and [=authentication extension=] enables use of a user verification index.

: Extension identifier
:: `uvi`

: Client extension input
:: The Boolean value `true` to indicate that this extension is requested by the [=[RP]=].

: Client extension processing
:: None, except creating the authenticator extension input from the client extension input.

: Client extension output
:: Returns a JSON string containing the base64url encoding of the authenticator extension output

: Authenticator extension input
:: The Boolean value `true`, encoded in CBOR (major type 7, value 21).

: Authenticator extension processing
:: The [=authenticator=] sets the [=authenticator extension output=] to be a user verification index indicating the method used
    by the user to authorize the operation, as defined below. This extension can be added to attestation objects and assertions.

: Authenticator extension output
:: The user verification index (UVI) is a value uniquely identifying a user verification data record. The UVI is encoded as CBOR
    byte string (type 0x58). Each UVI value MUST be specific to the related key (in order to provide unlinkability). It also
    must contain sufficient entropy that makes guessing impractical. UVI values MUST NOT be reused by the Authenticator (for
    other biometric data or users).

    The UVI data can be used by servers to understand whether an authentication was authorized by the exact same biometric data
    as the initial key generation. This allows the detection and prevention of "friendly fraud".

    As an example, the UVI could be computed as SHA256(KeyID | SHA256(rawUVI)), where the rawUVI reflects (a) the biometric
    reference data, (b) the related OS level user ID and (c) an identifier which changes whenever a factory reset is performed
    for the device, e.g. rawUVI = biometricReferenceData | OSLevelUserID | FactoryResetCounter.

    Servers supporting UVI extensions MUST support a length of up to 32 bytes for the UVI value.

    Example for [=authenticator data=] containing one UVI extension
    <pre>
        ...                                         -- [=RP ID=] hash (32 bytes)
        81                                          -- TUP and ED set
        00 00 00 01                                 -- (initial) signature counter
        ...                                         -- all public key alg etc.
        A1                                          -- extension: CBOR map of one element
            63                                      -- Key 1: CBOR text string of 3 bytes
                75 76 69                            -- "uvi" [=UTF-8 encoded=] string
            58 20                                   -- Value 1: CBOR byte string with 0x20 bytes
                00 43 B8 E3 BE 27 95 8C             -- the UVI value itself

## Location Extension (loc) ## {#sctn-location-extension}

The location [=registration extension=] and [=authentication extension=] provides the client device's current location to the
WebAuthn [=[RP]=].

: Extension identifier
:: `loc`

: Client extension input
:: The Boolean value `true` to indicate that this extension is requested by the [=[RP]=].

: Client extension processing
:: None, except creating the authenticator extension input from the client extension input.

: Client extension output
:: Returns a JSON object that encodes the location information in the authenticator extension output as a Coordinates value,
    as defined by [The W3C Geolocation API Specification](https://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#coordinates_interface).

: Authenticator extension input
:: The Boolean value `true`, encoded in CBOR (major type 7, value 21).

: Authenticator extension processing
:: If the [=authenticator=] does not support the extension, then the authenticator MUST ignore the extension request.
    If the [=authenticator=] accepts the extension, then the authenticator SHOULD only add this extension data to a packed
    attestation or assertion.

: Authenticator extension output
:: If the [=authenticator=] accepts the extension request, then [=authenticator extension output=] SHOULD provide location data
    in the form of a CBOR-encoded map, with the first value being the [=extension identifier=] and the second being an array of
    returned values. The array elements SHOULD be derived from (key,value) pairings for each location attribute that the
    [=authenticator=] supports. The following is an example of [=authenticator data=] where the returned array is comprised of a
    {longitude, latitude, altitude} triplet, following the coordinate representation defined in [The W3C Geolocation API
    Specification](https://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html#coordinates_interface).

    <pre>

This [=registration extension=] and [=authentication extension=] enables use of a user verification method.

: Extension identifier
:: `uvm`

: Client extension input
:: The Boolean value true to indicate that this extension is requested by the WebAuthn Relying Party.

: Client extension processing

: Authenticator extension input
:: The Boolean value `true`, encoded in CBOR (major type 7, value 21).

: Authenticator extension processing
:: The [=authenticator=] sets the [=authenticator extension output=] to be a user verification index indicating the method used
    by the user to authorize the operation, as defined below. This extension can be added to attestation objects and assertions.

: Authenticator extension output
:: Authenticators can report up to 3 different user verification methods (factors) used in a single authentication instance,
    using the CBOR syntax defined below:

    ```
    uvmFormat = [ 1*3 uvmEntry ]
    uvmEntry = [
                   userVerificationMethod: uint .size 4,
                   keyProtectionType: uint .size 2,
                   matcherProtectionType: uint .size 2
               ]
    ```

    The semantics of the fields in each `uvmEntry` are as follows:
    : userVerificationMethod
    :: The authentication method/factor used by the authenticator to verify the user. Available values are defined in
        [[!FIDOReg]], "User Verification Methods" section.

    : keyProtectionType

        in [[!FIDOReg]], "Key Protection Types" section.

    : matcherProtectionType
    :: The method used by the authenticator to protect the matcher that performs user verification. Available values are defined
        in [[!FIDOReg]], "Matcher Protection Types" section.

    If >3 factors can be used in an authentication instance the authenticator vendor must select the 3 factors it believes
    will be most relevant to the Server to include in the UVM.

    Example for [=authenticator data=] containing one UVM extension for a multi-factor authentication instance where 2 factors
    were used:

# Sample scenarios # {#sample-scenarios}

[INFORMATIVE]

In this section, we walk through some events in the lifecycle of a [=public key credential=], along with the corresponding
sample code for using this API. Note that this is an example flow, and does not limit the scope of how the API can be used.

As was the case in earlier sections, this flow focuses on a use case involving an external first-factor [=authenticator=]
with its own display. One example of such an authenticator would be a smart phone. Other authenticator types are also supported
by this API, subject to implementation by the platform. For instance, this flow also works without modification for the case of
an authenticator that is embedded in the client platform. The flow also works for the case of an authenticator without
its own display (similar to a smart card) subject to specific implementation considerations. Specifically, the client platform
needs to display any prompts that would otherwise be shown by the authenticator, and the authenticator needs to allow the client
platform to enumerate all the authenticator's credentials so that the client can have information to show appropriate prompts.


## Registration ## {#sample-registration}

This is the first-time flow, in which a new credential is created and registered with the server.

1. The user visits example.com, which serves up a script. At this point, the user must already be logged in using a legacy
    username and password, or additional authenticator, or other means acceptable to the [=[RP]=].

2. The [=[RP]=] script runs the code snippet below.

3. The client platform searches for and locates the authenticator.

4. The client platform connects to the authenticator, performing any pairing actions if necessary.

5. The authenticator shows appropriate UI for the user to select the authenticator on which the new credential will be
    created, and obtains a biometric or other authorization gesture from the user.

6. The authenticator returns a response to the client platform, which in turn returns a response to the [=[RP]=] script. If
    the user declined to select an authenticator or provide authorization, an appropriate error is returned.

7. If a new credential was created,
    - The [=[RP]=] script sends the newly generated [=credential public key=] to the server, along with additional information
        such as attestation regarding the provenance and characteristics of the authenticator.
    - The server stores the [=credential public key=] in its database and associates it with the user as well as with the
        characteristics of authentication indicated by attestation, also storing a friendly name for later use.
    - The script may store data such as the credential ID in local storage, to improve future UX by narrowing the choice of
        credential for the user.

The sample code for generating and registering a new key follows:

<pre class="example" highlight="js">
    if (!PublicKeyCredential) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var publicKey = {
      challenge: Uint8Array.from(window.atob("PGifxAoBwCkWkm4b1CiIl5otCphiIh6MijdjbWFjomA="), c=>c.charCodeAt(0)),

      // Relying Party:
      rp: {
        name: "Acme"
      },

      // User:
      user: {
        id: "1098237235409872"
        name: "john.p.smith@example.com",
        displayName: "John P. Smith",
        icon: "https://pics.acme.com/00/p/aBjjjpqPb.png"
      },

      // This Relying Party will accept either an ES256 or RS256 credential, but
      // prefers an ES256 credential.
      parameters: [
        {
          type: "public-key",
          algorithm: "ES256",
        },
        {
          type: "public-key",
          algorithm: "RS256",
        },
      ],

      timeout: 60000,  // 1 minute
      excludeCredentials: [], // No exclude list of PKCredDescriptors
      extensions: {"webauthn.location": true}  // Include location information
                                               // in attestation
    };

    // Note: The following call will cause the authenticator to display UI.
    navigator.credentials.create({ publicKey })
      .then(function (newCredentialInfo) {
        // Send new credential info to server for verification and registration.
      }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable authenticator or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
      });
</pre>


## Authentication ## {#sample-authentication}

This is the flow when a user with an already registered credential visits a website and wants to authenticate using the
credential.

1. The user visits example.com, which serves up a script.

2. The script asks the client platform for an Authentication Assertion, providing as much information as possible to narrow
    the choice of acceptable credentials for the user. This may be obtained from the data that was stored locally after
    registration, or by other means such as prompting the user for a username.

3. The [=[RP]=] script runs one of the code snippets below.

4. The client platform searches for and locates the authenticator.

5. The client platform connects to the authenticator, performing any pairing actions if necessary.

6. The authenticator presents the user with a notification that their attention is required. On opening the
    notification, the user is shown a friendly selection menu of acceptable credentials using the account information provided
    when creating the credentials, along with some information on the [=origin=] that is requesting these keys.

7. The authenticator obtains a biometric or other authorization gesture from the user.

8. The authenticator returns a response to the client platform, which in turn returns a response to the [=[RP]=] script.
    If the user declined to select a credential or provide an authorization, an appropriate error is returned.

9. If an assertion was successfully generated and returned,
    - The script sends the assertion to the server.
    - The server examines the assertion, extracts the credential ID, looks up the registered
        credential public key it is database, and verifies the assertion's authentication signature.
        If valid, it looks up the identity associated with the assertion's credential ID; that
        identity is now authenticated. If the credential ID is not recognized by the server (e.g.,
        it has been deregistered due to inactivity) then the authentication has failed; each [=[RP]=]
        will handle this in its own way.
    - The server now does whatever it would otherwise do upon successful authentication -- return a success page, set
        authentication cookies, etc.

If the [=[RP]=] script does not have any hints available (e.g., from locally stored data) to help it narrow the list of
credentials, then the sample code for performing such an authentication might look like this:

<pre class="example" highlight="js">
    if (!PublicKeyCredential) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var options = {
                    challenge: new TextEncoder().encode("climb a mountain"),
                    timeout: 60000,  // 1 minute
                    allowCredentials: [{ type: "public-key" }]
                  };

    navigator.credentials.get({ "publicKey": options })
        .then(function (assertion) {
        // Send assertion to server for verification
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable credential or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
</pre>

On the other hand, if the [=[RP]=] script has some hints to help it narrow the list of credentials, then the sample code for
performing such an authentication might look like the following. Note that this sample also demonstrates how to use the
extension for transaction authorization.

<pre class="example" highlight="js">
    if (!PublicKeyCredential) { /* Platform not capable. Handle error. */ }

    var encoder = new TextEncoder();
    var acceptableCredential1 = {
        type: "public-key",
        id: encoder.encode("!!!!!!!hi there!!!!!!!\n")
    };
    var acceptableCredential2 = {
        type: "public-key",
        id: encoder.encode("roses are red, violets are blue\n")
    };

    var options = {
                    challenge: encoder.encode("climb a mountain"),
                    timeout: 60000,  // 1 minute
                    allowCredentials: [acceptableCredential1, acceptableCredential2];
                    extensions: { 'webauthn.txauth.simple':
                       "Wave your hands in the air like you just don't care" };
                  };

    navigator.credentials.get({ "publicKey": options })
        .then(function (assertion) {
        // Send assertion to server for verification
    }).catch(function (err) {
        // No acceptable credential or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
    });
</pre>


## Decommissioning ## {#sample-decommissioning}

The following are possible situations in which decommissioning a credential might be desired. Note that all of these are
handled on the server side and do not need support from the API specified here.

- Possibility #1 -- user reports the credential as lost.
    * User goes to server.example.net, authenticates and follows a link to report a lost/stolen device.
    * Server returns a page showing the list of registered credentials with friendly names as configured during registration.
    * User selects a credential and the server deletes it from its database.
    * In future, the [=[RP]=] script does not specify this credential in any list of acceptable credentials, and assertions
        signed by this credential are rejected.

- Possibility #2 -- server deregisters the credential due to inactivity.
    * Server deletes credential from its database during maintenance activity.
    * In the future, the [=[RP]=] script does not specify this credential in any list of acceptable credentials, and assertions
        signed by this credential are rejected.

- Possibility #3 -- user deletes the credential from the device.
    * User employs a device-specific method (e.g., device settings UI) to delete a credential from their device.
    * From this point on, this credential will not appear in any selection prompts, and no assertions can be generated with it.
    * Sometime later, the server deregisters this credential due to inactivity.

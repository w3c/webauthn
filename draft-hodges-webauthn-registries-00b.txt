1.  Introduction

   This specification defines IANA registries for W3C Web Authentication
   [WebAuthn] attestation formats and extension identifiers, and
   supplies initial entries within each registry.

2.  Registering WebAuthn Attestation Formats

   WebAuthn attestation format identifiers are strings whose semantic,
   syntactic, uniqueness, and string-matching criteria are specified in
   [WebAuthn], along with the concepts of attestation and attestation
   formats.

   WebAuthn attestation formats are registered on the advice of a
   Designated Expert (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a
   Specification Required (per [RFC5226]).

   The Expert(s) will establish procedures for requesting registrations,
   and make them available from the registry page.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  WebAuthn Attestation Format Identifier:
   o  Description: A relatively short description of the attestation
      format.
   o  Specification Document: Reference to the specification of the
      attestation format.
   o  Notes: [optional]

   The Expert(s) MAY define additional fields to be collected in the
   registry.

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)     June 2016


   See Section 4.2 for intial registrations, which may be used as
   examples for subsequent registrations.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available specification, e.g.,
   as described in [RFC2026] Section 7.

   Note that WebAuthn attestation formats can be registered by third
   parties, if the Expert(s) determine that an unregistered attestation
   format is widely deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely
   manner.

   Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be
   first appealed to Application Area Directors (contactable using app-
   ads@tools.ietf.org email address or directly by looking up their
   email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) and, if the
   appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the full IESG (using
   the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).


3.  Registering WebAuthn Extension Identifiers

   WebAuthn extension identifiers are strings whose semantic, syntactic,
   uniqueness, and string-matching criteria are specified in [WebAuthn].

   WebAuthn extension identifiers are registered on the advice of a
   Designated Expert (appointed by the IESG or their delegate), with a
   Specification Required (per [RFC5226]).

   The Expert(s) will establish procedures for requesting registrations,
   and make them available from the registry page.

   Registration requests consist of at least the following information:

   o  WebAuthn Extension Identifier:
   o  Description: A relatively short description of the extension.
   o  Specification Document: Reference to the specification of the
      extension.
   o  Notes: [optional]

   The Expert(s) MAY define additional fields to be collected in the
   registry.

   See Section 4.3 for intial registrations, which may be used as
   examples for subsequent registrations.

   Registrations MUST reference a freely available specification, e.g.,
   as described in [RFC2026] Section 7.

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)     June 2016


   Note that WebAuthn extensions can be registered by third parties, if
   the Expert(s) determine that an unregistered extension is widely
   deployed and not likely to be registered in a timely manner.

   Decisions (or lack thereof) made by the Designated Expert can be
   first appealed to Application Area Directors (contactable using app-
   ads@tools.ietf.org email address or directly by looking up their
   email addresses on http://www.iesg.org/ website) and, if the
   appellant is not satisfied with the response, to the full IESG (using
   the iesg@iesg.org mailing list).


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  WebAuthn Attestation Formats and Extension Identifiers Registries

   This specification establishes two registries:

   o  the WebAuthn Attestation Formats registry; see Section 2.  Initial
      registry contents are given in Section 4.2.
   o  the WebAuthn Extension Identifiers registry; see Section 3.
      Initial registry contents are given in Section 4.3.

   For both registries, the Expert(s) and IANA will interact as outlined
   below:

   IANA will direct any incoming requests regarding the registry to the
   processes established by the Expert(s); typically, this will mean
   referring them to the registry HTML page.

   The Expert(s) will provide registry data to IANA in an agreed form
   (e.g. a specific XML format).  IANA will publish:

   o  The raw registry data
   o  The registry data, transformed into HTML
   o  The registry data in any alternative formats provided by the
      Expert(s)

   Each published document will be at a URL agreed to by IANA and the
   Expert(s), and IANA will set HTTP response headers on them as
   (reasonably) requested by the Expert(s).

   Additionally, the HTML generated by IANA will:

   o  Take directions from the Expert(s) as to the content of the HTML
      page's introductory text and markup
   o  Include a stable HTML fragment identifier for each registered
      attestation format or extension identifier

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)     June 2016


   All registry data documents MUST include Simplified BSD License text
   as described in Section 4.e of the Trust Legal Provisions
   (<http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info>).

4.2.  Initial WebAuthn Attestation Formats Registry Contents

   The WebAuthn Attestation Formats registry's initial contents are:

      WebAuthn Attestation Formats: packed
      Description: The "packed" attestation format is a WebAuthn-
      optimized format for attestation data.  It uses a very compact but
      still extensible encoding method.  This format is implementable by
      authenticators with limited resources (e.g., secure elements).
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Attestation Formats: tpm
      Description: The TPM attestation format returns an attestation
      statement in the same format as the packed attestation format,
      although the the rawData and signature fields are computed
      differently.
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Attestation Formats: android
      Description: Android-based, platform-provided authenticators may
      produce an attestation statement based on the Android SafetyNet
      API.
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Attestation Formats: android2
      Description: Platform-provided authenticators based on Android
      versions "N", and later, may provide a "hardware attestation"
      statement.
      Specification Document: [AndroidHWAttstn]


4.3.  Initial WebAuthn Extension Identifiers Registry Contents

   The WebAuthn Extension Identifiers registry's initial contents are:

      WebAuthn Extension Identifier: webauthn_txAuthSimple
      Description: This signature extension allows for a simple form of
      transaction authorization.  A WebAuthn Relying Party can specify a
      prompt string, intended for display on a trusted device on the
      authenticator
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]

Internet-DraftRegistries for Web Authentication (WebAuthn)     June 2016


      WebAuthn Extension Identifier: webauthn_txAuthGeneric
      Description: This generic txauth extension allows images to be
      used as prompts as well.  This allows authenticators without a
      font rendering engine to be used and also supports a richer visual
      appearance than accomplished with the webauthn.txauth.simple
      extension.
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Extension Identifier: webauthn_authnSel
      Description: This registration extension allows a WebAuthn Relying
      Party to guide the selection of the authenticator that will be
      leveraged when creating the credential.  It is intended primarily
      for WebAuthn Relying Parties that wish to tightly control the
      experience around credential creation.
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Extension Identifier: webauthn_exts
      Description: The Supported Extensions extension data is a list
      (CBOR array) of extension identifiers encoded as UTF-8 Strings.
      This extension is added automatically by the authenticator.  This
      extension can be added to attestation statements.
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Extension Identifier: webauthn_uvi
      Description: The user verification index (UVI) is a value uniquely
      identifying a user verification data record.  The UVI data can be
      used by servers to understand whether an authentication was
      authorized by the exact same biometric data as the initial key
      generation.  This allows the detection and prevention of "friendly
      fraud".
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Extension Identifier: webauthn_loc
      Description: The location extension provides the client device's
      current location to the WebAuthn relying party, if supported by
      the client device and subject to user consent.
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]


      WebAuthn Extension Identifier: webauthn_uvm
      Description: The user verification mode (UVM) extension returns to
      the Webauthn relying party which user verification methods
      (factors) were used for the WebAuthn operation.
      Specification Document: [WebAuthn]

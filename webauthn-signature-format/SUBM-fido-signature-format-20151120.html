    A FIDO 2.0 signature proves possession of a private key of a FIDO 2.0

<section id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>FIDO 2.0 signatures are bound to various contextual data. These data are
observed, and added at different levels of the stack as a signature request
passes from the server to the authenticator. In verifying a signature, the
server checks these bindings against expected values.</p>

<p>The components of a system using FIDO 2.0 can be divided into three layers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The relying party (RP), which uses the FIDO 2.0 services.
  The relying party may, for
  example, be a web-application running in a browser, or a native application
  that runs directly on the OS platform.</li>
  <li>The client platform, which consists of the user’s OS and device used to
  host the RP’s client-side app. For web-applications, the browser also belongs
  to this layer.</li>
  <li>The authenticator itself, which provides key management and
  cryptographic signatures.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the RP client-side application is a web-application, the interface between 1 and 2
is the FIDO 2.0 Web API [[FIDOWebApi]], but is platform specific for native applications.
In cases where the authenticator is not tightly integrated with the platform, the interface
between 2 and 3 is a separately-defined protocol.
This specification defines the common signature format
shared by all layers.  This includes how the different contextual bindings are
encoded, signed over, and delivered to the RP.</p>

<p>The goals of this design can be summarized as follows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scheme for generating signatures should accommodate cases where the
  link between the client platform and authenticator is very limited, in
  bandwidth and/or latency. Examples include Bluetooth Low Energy and Near-Field
  Communication.</li>
  <li>The data processed by the authenticator should be small and easy to
  interpret in low-level code. In particular, authenticators should not have to
  parse high-level encodings such as JSON.</li>
  <li>Both the client platform and the authenticator should have the flexibility
  to add contextual bindings as needed.</li>
  <li>The design aims to reuse as much as possible of existing encoding formats
  in order to aid adoption and implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The contextual bindings are divided in two: Those added by the RP or the
client platform, referred to as <dfn>client data</dfn>; and those added by the
authenticator, referred to as the <dfn>authenticator data</dfn>.  The client
data must be signed over, but an authenticator is otherwise not interested in
its contents. To save bandwidth and processing requirements on the
authenticator, the client platform hashes the client data and sends only
the result to the authenticator. The authenticator signs over the combination
of this hash, and its own authenticator data.</p>
</section>

<section id="client-data">
  <h2>Client data</h2>

  <p>The client data represents the contextual bindings of both the RP and the
  client platform.  It is a key-value mapping with string-valued keys. Values may be
  any type that has a valid encoding in JSON.  It MUST contain at least the
  following key-value pairs.</p>
  <dl class="idl" title="dictionary ClientData">
    <dt>DOMString challenge</dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url-encoded challenge provided by the RP.
    </dd>
    <dt>DOMString facet</dt>
    <dd>
      A string value describing the RP identifier facet.
      When the RP client-side app is a website, this is its fully qualified web origin,
      using the syntax defined by [[RFC6454]]. When the client-side app is a native
      application, this string is a platform specific identifier.
    </dd>
    <dt>JsonWebKey tokenBinding</dt>
    <dd>
      A JsonWebKey object [[JWK]] describing the public key that this client uses for
      the Token Binding protocol when communicating with the Relying Party.
      This can be omitted if no Token Binding has been negotiated between the
      client and the Relying Party.
    </dd>
    <dt>optional object extensions</dt>
    <dd>
      An object with extension-provided authenticator data.
      Signature extensions are detailed in Section <a href="#extensions"></a>.
    </dd>
    <dt>DOMString hashAlg</dt>
    <dd>
      The hash algorithm used to compute clientDataHash 
      (see <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>).  Use "S256" for SHA-256, 
      "S384" for SHA384, "S512" for SHA512, and "SM3" for SM3 
      (see <a href='#iana-considerations'></a>). 
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The client data MAY contain additional properties.</p>

  <p>Before making a request to an authenticator, the
  client platform layer SHALL perform the following steps.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Let <code>clientDataJSON</code> be the UTF-8 encoded JSON serialization
    [[RFC7159]] of <code>clientData</code>.</li>

    <li>Let <code>clientDataHash</code> be the hash (computed using <code>hashAlg</code>) of 
    <code>clientDataJSON</code>, as an array.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The <code>clientDataHash</code> value is incorporated into a signature
  by a FIDO authenticator (see <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>).
  It is delivered to integrated authenticators
  in platform specific manners, and to external authenticators as a part of
  a signature request.
  The client platform SHOULD also preserve the exact <code>encodedClientData</code>
  string used to create it, for embedding in a signature object sent back to
  the RP (see <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>).
  This is necessary since multiple JSON encodings of the same client
  data are possible.</p>
  <p>The hash algorithm <code>hashAlg</code> used to compute <code>clientDataHash</code> is 
    included in the <code>clientData</code> object. This way it is available to the RP and 
    it is also hashed over when computing <code>clientDataHash</code> and hence
    anchored in the signature itself.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="authenticator-data">
  <h2>Authenticator data</h2>

  <p>The authenticator data encodes contextual bindings made by the
  authenticator itself. The authenticator data has a compact but extensible
  encoding. This is desired since authenticators can be devices with limited
  capabilities and low power requirements, with much simpler software stacks
  than the client platform components.</p>

  <p>The encoding of authenticator data is a byte array <code>authenticatorData</code>
  of 5 bytes or more, as follows.</p>
  <table class="simple">
    <tr>
      <th>Byte index</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>Flags (bit 0 is the least significant bit):
        <ul>
          <li>Bit 0: Test of User Presence (<code>TUP</code>) result.</li>
          <li>Bits 1-6: Reserved for future use (<code>RFU</code>).</li>
          <li>Bit 7: Extension data included (<code>ED</code>). Indicates if the
          authenticator data has extensions.</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1-4</td>
      <td>Signature counter (<code>signCount</code>), 32-bit unsigned big-endian integer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5-</td>
      <td>Extension-defined authenticator data. This is a CBOR [[RFC7049]] map with extension
      identifiers as keys, and extension authenticator data values as values. See 
      <a href="#extensions"></a> for details.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The <code>TUP</code> flag SHALL be set if and only if the authenticator
  detected a user through an authenticator specific gesture. The <code>RFU</code>
  bits in the flags byte SHALL be set to zero.</p>

  <p>If the authenticator does not include any extension data, it MUST set the
  <code>ED</code> flag in the first byte to zero, and to one if extension data
  is included.</p>

  <p><a href="#fig-authenticatordata"></a> shows a visual representation of the
  authenticator data structure.</p>

  <figure id="fig-authenticatordata">

    <figcaption><code>authenticatorData</code> layout.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="note">
  The <code>signatureData</code> describes its own length: If the ED flag is not set, it
  is always 5 bytes long. If the ED flag is set, it is 5 bytes plus the CBOR map that follows.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="authenticator-signature">
  <h2>Generating a signature</h2>

  <p>A raw cryptographic signature must assert the integrity of both the
  client data and the authenticator data. Thus, an authenticator SHALL
  compute a signature over the concatenation of the <code>authenticatorData</code>
  and the <code>clientDataHash</code>.
  </p>

  <figure id="fig-signature">
    <img src="img/fido-signature-formats-figure2.svg"/>
    <figcaption>Generating a signature on the authenticator.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p class="note">
    A simple, undelimited concatenation, is safe to use here because the
    <code>authenticatorData</code> describes its own length. The 
    <code>clientDataHash</code> (which potentially has a variable length) 
    is always the last element.
  </p>

  <p>
    The authenticator MUST return both the <code>authenticatorData</code> and
    the raw signature back to the client.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="fido-assertion">
  <h2>Client encoding of assertions</h2>

  <p>The client platform uses an authenticator assertion to construct
  the final <dfn>FIDO assertion</dfn> object returned to the RP as follows.</p>

  <dl class="idl" title="interface FIDOAssertion">
    <dt>attribute Credential credential</dt>
    <dd>
    	An object representing which credential was used to generate an assertion.
    </dd>
    <dt>attribute DOMString clientData</dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url encoding of <code>clientDataJSON</code>.
      (See <a href="#client-data"></a>)
    </dd>
    <dt>attribute DOMString authenticatorData</dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url encoding of <code>authenticatorData</code>.
      (See <a href="#authenticator-data"></a>)
    </dd>
    <dt>attribute DOMString signature</dt>
    <dd>
      A base64url encoding of the raw signature returned from the authenticator.
      (See <a href="#authenticator-signature"></a>)
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>This assertion is delivered to the RP in either a platform specific manner, or
  in the case of web applications, according to the FIDO Web API [[FIDOWebApi]].
  It contains all the information that the RP's FIDO server requires to
  reconstruct the signature base string, as well as to decode and validate
  the bindings of both the client- and authenticator data.</p>
</section>

<section id="extensions">
<h2>FIDO Extensions</h2>

<p>
  The mechanism for generating FIDO 2.0 credentials, as well as requesting and
  generating FIDO 2.0 assertions, as defined in [[FIDOWebApi]] and in this
  specification, can be extended to suit particular use cases. Each case is
  addressed by defining a <em>registration extension</em> and/or a
  <em>signature extension</em>. Extensions can define additions to the
  following steps and data:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>makeCredential</code> request parameters (see [[FIDOWebApi]]) for
    registration extension.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>getAssertion</code> request parameters (see [[FIDOWebApi]]) for
    signature extensions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Client processing, and the <code>clientData</code> structure, for
    registration extensions and signature extensions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Authenticator processing, and the <code>authenticatorData</code>
    structure, for signature extensions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When requesting an assertion for a FIDO 2.0 credential, an RP can list a set
  of extensions to be used, if they are supported by the client and/or the
  authenticator. It sends the request parameters for each extension in the
  <code>getAssertion</code> call (for signature extensions) or
  <code>makeCredential</code> call (for registration extensions) to the client
  platform. The client platform performs additional processing for each
  extension that it supports, and augments <code>clientData</code> as required
  by the extension. For extensions that the client platform does not support,
  it passes the request parameters on to the authenticator when possible
  (criteria defined below). This allows one to define extensions that affect
  the authenticator only.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, the authenticator performs additional processing for the
  extensions that it supports, and augments <code>authenticatorData</code> as
  specified by the extension.
</p>
<p>
  Extensions that are not supported are ignored.
</p>

<section id="extension-id">
  <h2>Extension identifiers</h2>

  <p>
  Extensions are identified by a string, chosen by the extension author. Extension identifiers
  should aim to be globally unique, e.g. by using reverse domain-name of the defining entity such
  as <code>com.example.fido.myextension</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Extensions that may exist in multiple versions should take care to include a version
  in their identifier. In effect, different versions are thus treated as different extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
  Standard extensions defined by FIDO in this specification use a fixed prefix of <code>fido.</code>
  for the extension identifiers. This prefix should not be used for 3rd party extensions.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="extension-specification">
  <h2>Defining extensions</h2>

  <p>
    A definition of an extension must specify, at minimum, an extension
    identifier and an extension client argument sent via the
    <code>getAssertion</code> or <code>makeCredential</code> call (see below).
    Additionally, extensions may specify additional values in
    <code>clientData</code>, <code>authenticatorData</code> (in the case of
    signature extensions), or both.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    An extension that does not define additions to <code>clientData</code> nor
    <code>authenticatorData</code> is possible, but should be avoided. In such
    cases, the relying party would have no indication if the extension was
    supported or processed by the client and/or authenticator.
  </p>

<section id="extension-request-parameters">
  <h2>Extending request parameters</h2>

  <p>
    An extension defines two request arguments. The <dfn>client argument</dfn>
    is passed from the RP to the client in the <code>getAssertion</code> or
    <code>makeCredential</code> call, while the <dfn>authenticator
    argument</dfn> is passed from the client to the authenticator during the
    processing of these calls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Extension definitions MUST specify the valid values for their client
    argument. Clients are free to ignore extensions with an invalid client
    argument. Specifying an authenticator argument is optional, since some
    extensions may only affect client processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    An RP simultaneously requests the use of an extension and sets its client
    argument by including an entry in the <code>extensions</code> dictionary
    parameter to the <code>getAssertion</code> or <code>makeCredential</code>
    call. The entry key MUST be the extension identifier, and the value
    MUST be the client argument.
  </p>

  <pre class="example highlight">
  var assertionPromise = credentials.getAssertion(..., /* extensions */ {
    "com.example.fido.foobar": 42
  });
  </pre>

  <p>
    Extensions that affect the behavior of the client platform can define their
    argument to be any set of values that can be encoded in JSON. Such an
    extension will in general (but not always) specify additional values to the
    <code>clientData</code> structure (see below). It may also specify an
    authenticator argument that platforms implementing the extension are
    expected to send to the authenticator. The authenticator argument should be
    a byte string.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Extensions should aim to define authenticator arguments that are as small
    as possible. Some authenticators communicate over low-bandwidth links such
    as Bluetooth Low-Energy or NFC.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Extensions that do not need to pass any particular argument value, must
    still define a client argument. It is recommended that the argument be
    defined as the constant value <code>true</code> in this case.
  </p>

  <p>
    For extensions that specify additional authenticator processing only, it is
    desirable that the platform need not know the extension. To support this,
    platforms SHOULD pass the client argument of unknown extension as the
    authenticator argument unchanged, under the same extension identifier. The
    authenticator argument should be the CBOR encoding of the client argument,
    as specified in Section 4.2 of [[RFC7049]]. Clients SHOULD silently drop
    unknown extensions whose client argument cannot be encoded as a CBOR
    structure.

  <h2>Extending client processing</h2>
  <p>
    Extensions may define additional processing requirements on the client
    platform during the creation of credentials or the generation of an
    assertion. In order for the RP to verify the processing took place, or if
    the processing has a result value that the RP needs to be aware of, the
    extension should specify a client data value to be included in the
    <code>clientData</code> structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The value may be any value that can be encoded as a JSON value. If any
    extension processed by a client defines such a value, the client SHOULD
    include a dictionary in <code>clientData</code> with the key
    <code>extensions</code>. For each such extension, the client SHOULD add an
    entry to this dictionary with the extension identifier as the key, and the
    extension's client data value.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="extension-authenticator-processing">
  <h2>Extending authenticator processing with signature extensions</h2>
  <p>
    Signature extensions that define additional authenticator processing should
    similarly define an authenticator data value. The value may be any data
    that can be encoded as a CBOR value. An authenticator that processes a
    signature extension that defines such a value must include it in the
    <code>authenticatorData</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As specified in <a href="#authenticator-data"></a>, the authenticator data
    value of each processed extension is included in the extended data part of
    the <code>authenticatorData</code>. This part is a CBOR map, with extension
    identifiers as keys, and the authenticator data value of each extension as
    the value.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="extension-example">
  <h2>Example extension</h2>
  <p>This section is non-normative.</p>
  <p>
    To illustrate the requirements above, consider a hypothetical extension
    <em>Geo</em>. This extension, if supported, lets both clients and
    authenticators embed their geolocation in signatures.
  </p>

  <p>
    The extension identifier is chosen as <code>com.example.fido.geo</code>.
    The client argument is the constant value <code>true</code>, since the
    extension does not require the RP to pass any particular information to the
    client, other than that it requests the use of the extension. The RP sets
    this value in its request for an assertion:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight">
  var assertionPromise =
      credentials.getAssertion("SGFuIFNvbG8gc2hvdCBmaXJzdC4",
          {}, /* Empty filter */
          { 'com.example.fido.geo': true });
  </pre>

  <p>
  The extension defines the additional client data to be the client's location, if known,
  as a GeoJSON [[GeoJSON]] point. The client constructs the following client data:
  </p>
  <pre class="highlight">
  {
     ...,
     'extensions': {
         'com.example.fido.geo': {
             'type': 'Point',
             'coordinates': [65.059962, -13.993041]
         }
     }
  }
  </pre>

  <p>
  The extension also requires the client to set the authenticator parameter to the fixed value
  <code>1</code>. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, the extension requires the authenticator to specify its geolocation in the authenticator
  data, if known. The extension e.g. specifies that the location shall be encoded as a two-element
  array of floating point numbers, encoded with CBOR.
  An authenticator does this by including it in the <code>authenticatorData</code>.
  As an example, authenticator data may be as follows (notation taken from [[RFC7049]]):
  </p>

  <pre>
  81 (hex)                      -- Flags, ED and TUP both set.
  20 05 58 1F                   -- Signature counter
  A1                            -- CBOR map of one element
    68                          -- Key 1: CBOR text string of 8 bytes
      66 69 64 6F 2E 67 65 6F   -- "fido.geo" UTF-8 string
    82                          -- Value 1: CBOR array of two elements
      FA 42 82 1E B3            -- Element 1: Latitude as CBOR encoded float
      FA C1 5F E3 7F            -- Element 2: Longitude as CBOR encoded float

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines algorithm encodings and representations
   enabling the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG)
   elliptic curve "secp256k1" [SEC2] to be used for JSON Object Signing
   and Encryption (JOSE) [RFC7515] and CBOR Object Signing and
   Encryption (COSE) [RFC8152] messages.  The elliptic curve and
   associated algorithm are registered in appropriate IANA JOSE and COSE
   registries.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  JOSE and COSE secp256k1 Curve Key Representations

   The Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG) elliptic curve
   "secp256k1" [SEC2] is represented in a JSON Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517]
   using these values:

   o  "kty": "EC"
   o  "crv": "P-256K"

   plus "x" and "y" values to represent the curve point for the key.
   Other optional values such as "alg" MAY also be present.

Internet-Draft     Using secp256k1 with JOSE and COSE           May 2018


   It is represented in a COSE_Key [RFC8152] using these values:

   o  "kty" (1): "EC2" (2)
   o  "crv" (-1): "P-256K" (TBD - requested assignment 8)

   plus "x" (-2) and "y" (-3) values to represent the curve point for
   the key.  Other optional values such as "alg" (3) MAY also be
   present.

3.  ECDSA Signature with secp256k1 Curve

   The ECDSA signature algorithm is defined in [DSS].  Implementations
   need to check that the key type is "EC" for JOSE or "EC2" (2) for
   COSE when creating or verifying a signature.

   The ECDSA algorithm specified in this document is:

   +--------------+---------------------------+------------------------+
   | JOSE Alg     | COSE Alg Value            | Description            |
   | Name         |                           |                        |
   +--------------+---------------------------+------------------------+
   | ES256K       | TBD (requested assignment | ECDSA w/ secp256k1     |
   |              | -43)                      | Curve                  |
   +--------------+---------------------------+------------------------+

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  JSON Web Key Elliptic Curve Registration

   This section registers the following value in the IANA "JSON Web Key
   Elliptic Curve" registry [IANA.JOSE.Curves].

   o  Curve Name: P-256K
   o  Curve Description: SECG secp256k1 Curve
   o  JOSE Implementation Requirements: Optional
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Specification Document(s): Section 2 of [[ this specification ]]

4.2.  JOSE Algorithm Registration

   This section registers the following value in the IANA "JSON Web
   Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry [IANA.JOSE.Algorithms].

   o  Algorithm Name: ES256K
   o  Algorithm Description: ECDSA w/ secp256k1 Curve
   o  Algorithm Usage Locations: alg

   o  JOSE Implementation Requirements: Optional
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Reference: Section 3 of [[ this specification ]]
   o  Algorithm Analysis Document(s): [SEC2]

4.3.  COSE Elliptic Curves Registration

   This section registers the following value in the IANA "COSE Elliptic
   Curves" registry [IANA.COSE.Curves].

   o  Name: P-256K
   o  Value: TBD (requested assignment 8)
   o  Key Type: EC2
   o  Description: SECG secp256k1 Curve
   o  Change Controller: IESG
   o  Reference: Section 2 of [[ this specification ]]
   o  Recommended: Yes

4.4.  COSE Algorithm Registration

   This section registers the following value in the IANA "COSE
   Algorithms" registry [IANA.COSE.Algorithms].

   o  Name: ES256K
   o  Value: TBD (requested assignment -43)
   o  Description: ECDSA w/ secp256k1 Curve
   o  Reference: Section 3 of this document
   o  Recommended: Yes

5.  Security Considerations

   Care should be taken that a secp256k1 key not be mistaken for a P-256
   key, given that their representations are the same except for the
   "crv" value.

   The procedures and security considerations described in the [SEC1],
   [SEC2], and [DSS] specifications apply to implementations of this
   specification.
